   "reviewBody": "Blurring the line between what&apos;s real & what&apos;s reconstructed from scratch, Close-Up is truly unique in what it pulls off over the course of its runtime and is an incredibly original, meditative & masterly constructed example of experimental filmmaking that offers an interesting glimpse into the psyche of a complicated man while showcasing the power of cinema itself.\n\nSet in Iran, Close-Up covers the real-life trial of a cinephile who impersonated an acclaimed Iranian filmmaker and successfully conned a wealthy family in Tehran into believing that they would star in his new feature, that is until his luck ran out. The plot captures the ensuing trial that&apos;s filmed by the crew as it transpires in the courthouse while interspersed within those images are reenactments of the case.\n\nDirected by Abbas Kiarostami, Close-Up marks my first stint with his works & what instantly caught my attention was the opening credits that showed every cast member to be playing themselves, an unusually surprising move. Kiarostami&apos;s direction deserves kudos for he manages to erase the line that differentiates reality from fiction by using same individuals who were involved in the real-life scene to reenact the earlier events.\n\nWhat&apos;s also striking is that the reconstructed segments retain the raw, crude & untainted quality of recorded footage, while everything that unfolds in the courthouse is not a result of any rehearsed wordplay. Although the confession of the accused gives us a peek into his complex persona as well as his thought process, it also elegantly exposes the existing divide between the rich & the poor in Iranian society.\n\nThroughout the trial, Kiarostami tries to get the perpetrator&apos;s side of the story on the camera and while there are times that make you wonder if he&apos;s still staging an act or is being honest, some of the things said by him do reflect a bitter truth about the society we live in, like when he talks about the love, respect & hospitality he received from the family when he pretended to be someone else, something he never would&apos;ve experienced otherwise.\n\nIt&apos;s not that you can&apos;t differentiate between what&apos;s real & what&apos;s reenacted in Close-Up but the way its entire plot is executed, it makes you forget that deception & allows you experience it for what it is. Cinematography makes splendid use of the camera which is brilliantly utilised for long unbroken takes, hidden recordings, fixed smooth pans & fluid movements while Editing cleverly arranges the different segments into one consistently engaging narrative.\n\nOn an overall scale, Close-Up is an expertly crafted docufiction about human identity and captures it in its most natural form. Real-life can be just as full of drama & spices as any story brought to life on a film canvas and both forms inspire one another more often than usual. Although regarded by many to be one of modern cinema&apos;s greatest works, Close-Up didn&apos;t enthral me enough to join that particular crowd but I do admire its uniqueness, originality & honesty. Definitely recommended.",

   "reviewBody": "I, personally, cannot understand why so many people have left negative comments about this film. When it was released, many of us were young children and we all enjoyed it, but now that we are older, too many people are pointing out the bad jokes and mistakes and clich\u00e9s that they have found. The point is, this is a children&apos;s film, and we didn&apos;t see those mistakes when we were children because it&apos;s designed that way. Even so, people fail to see deeper into certain aspects of the film. Peter Pan was meant to be &apos;the boy who never grew up&apos;, so to have a tale of his adult life and to show how he forgot Neverland is a special and unique take on the story, one that won&apos;t be forgotten.\n\nThere have also been many complaints about the scene where Tink becomes human-size and expresses some kind of love for Peter. Although she is not a human per se, she can have human feelings, so why would she not love him? As the original story tells, she is often jealous of other womens&apos; affections towards him, and this film just extrapolates on that theme a little.\n\nThere have been comments about the &apos;father-who-is-so-busy-and-can&apos;t-go-to-the-game&apos; clich\u00e9. Well, here&apos;s news for you. It&apos;s clich\u00e9 because it happens all the time, and it&apos;s a truth! Some parents are just too busy to care. Lastly, too many people are moaning that Hook was too comical to be the bad guy. Well, this is a kids film and if he wasn&apos;t a little bit cheery-in-a-maniac sort of way, you&apos;d have parents complaining that their kids were scared.\n\nThe main thing about this film is that it is really good, but it IS designed for children, and adults who go back and watch it years later, then suddenly spot loads of mistakes are just ruining it for themselves and others.",

   "reviewBody": "Not in the same league as the first 2 Alien films. The special effects were well done, and while the action scenes were excellent, there weren&apos;t nearly enough of them. Nothing against director David Fincher, but I would not put him in the same class as Ridley Scott and James Cameron (directors of the first 2 films). This movie did not have a great flow. For the better part of an hour, we&apos;re left listening to dull dialogue, before the action picks up. At least with the first Alien film, the suspense kept up the pace of the movie. Also, aside from Lt. Ripley, none of the other characters are the least bit interesting in this film. This movie is enjoyable, and better than a many sci-fi movies out there, but I would not consider this one to be a classic.",

Lupin is a character that&apos;s capable of solving and tackling every situation, which results in the movie not having much tension or conflict within the character. He&apos;s admirable to watch, but difficult to sink into. That&apos;s how the movie is too. It is predictable, but none the less, exciting at times. The plot becomes predictable because we notice Lupin ready to solve the impending doom. Characters expect a lot from Lupin, which makes the movie a li&apos;l bit illogical. The animation is gorgeous to look at, but the characters&apos; dubbing is sometimes minutely off and a certain sense of uncanny valley-ness is noticeable in the way they speak. This is strictly a kids&apos; film, as they will enjoy and marvel at the glory of Lupin&apos;s quirky and charming persona. I liked it. And also, killer soundtrack, man.",

   "heading": "A Bond for a new era",
   "reviewBody": "A James Bond film made for the modern era, you&apos;d be hard pressed to find any other film series able to stand the test of time and still feel relevant. When it looks like it&apos;s lagging behind the competition of the other spy action thrillers, the makers have taken note and re-invented the mould, making it more real and exciting.\n\nTo me, Bond had too much of a rigid formula, the cars, the chases, the girls, the gadgets, the megalomaniac villain&apos;s and the spectacular set pieces/stunts. After a while though, the older films seem to suffer from a sense of deja vu. It&apos;s a case of been there, done that. The structure of the films have become stale and repetitive. Same plot about a group of criminals/organisation hell bent on world domination/destruction, with a beautiful bond girl in tow, Bond and or Bond girl gets capture, ridiculous car chase or stunts with a million of cheesy one liners. Frankly, I had pretty much given up on the Bond films. They have become predictable and tedious with only the change of location to give the film any sort of distinction.\n\nThe plot of Skyfall is unlike previous Bond films, starts with the routine chase resulting in Bond being shot and wounded, believed to be dead by MI6. When an attack on MI6 headquarters manifest through a cyber attack and a bombing at the headquarters, Bond returns to uncover who is behind the assault. Struggling from his gun shot wound, Bond has to prove his fitness mentally and physically through some rigorous tests. Sent back into action without being fully fit, Bond embarks on the mission to expose the mastermind. What Bond discovers is a villain who happens to be ex-agent who has a vendetta against M and will stop at nothing to kill her.\n\nFirst thing you&apos;ll notice is the lack of gadgets and the usually bond girl (there is one of sorts but you&apos;ll understand when you watch it). Also with a villain who is suave yet as equally menacing as Hannibal Lector, we have a loose cannon who isn&apos;t after the world but revenge. It&apos;s spy vs spy and the story is more of a evolution of the characters that inhabit the world of Bond. Nods to older Bond films crop up from dialogue, props and even the classic Austin Martin car makes an appearance. It&apos;s a homage as well as a resurrection of well known characters.\n\nWhat we are given here is a Bond with more layers to him and more emotions. Daniel Craig has moulded a Bond who is more relateable. Signs of physical and emotional weakness shows us a Bond who is no longer a super spy with little or no vulnerability. Other characters are given more screen time and provide an emotion gravitas (We are also introduced to Q, a young model who is still wet behind the ears).\n\nIn the hands of Sam Mendes and Director of photography Roger Deakins, there has never been a more beautiful shot Bond film. During Bond&apos;s fight with a criminal minion we see only their silhouettes, but the eye is drawn to the beauty of the neon Shanghai backdrop. The reserve can be said for the grime, dour and rainy streets of London which captures our the United Kingdom perfectly.\n\nIt&apos;s a satisfying and enjoyable film, with plenty of action and a surprising emotional core to the narrative. A great development in characters with seeds being sown to allow for a more relateable and mature story telling and for future characters to come to the fore. Skyfall has made me fall in love with Bond films again so here&apos;s hoping there&apos;s no more rigid formula and routine mundane narratives of past.",

   "reviewBody": "In the year 1993, Hollywood saw something unlike anything else, the film Jurassic Park. Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.\n\nThe plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn&apos;t seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn&apos;t the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.\n\nThis is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn&apos;t even in the top 250. Today, people don&apos;t appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90&apos;s, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn&apos;t understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.\n\nThis spawned two sequels. The second one wasn&apos;t bad, but the third wasn&apos;t very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.\n\nThe story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone&apos;s life is at stake.\n\nThe special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.\n\nYounger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren&apos;t scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.\n\nI highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.\n\nWatch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.\n\nEnjoy",

   "reviewBody": "Lets be frank. If you had a dime for every time Hollywood took something dusty and old, and tried to turn it into something shiny and new, you could retire.\n\nIn fact, most of these attempts barely work. But (having seen this one front to back three times since its first release) I believe this is an exception and moreover I believe that viewers have become so jaded to these attempts that they instinctively rebelled against the film (hence the low rating) without even giving it a chance.\n\nThe script by Seth Grahame-Smith is witty and clever and engaging. And wonderfully demented. The cast is to die for. Eva Green and Johnny Depp are at the peak of their craft, delivering with a straight face bits of dialog that lesser actors would choke on. The supporting cast (almost all A-list with a young Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz) is rock solid.\n\nOverall a delightfully deranged yet still entertaining exercise in being silly -- which is exactly what Hollywood aims for in these odd exercises.\n\nThe IMDb rating is much too low. Give it another chance.",

His job is to find the dolphin and return it before The Miami Dolphins&apos; crucial game.\n\nJim Carrey is quite simply amazing, I never stopped laughing the whole way through the movie. This is surely Carrey&apos;s best work, even now. OK, Dumb and Dumber and The Mask are very funny movies too, but this takes the biscuit. Everything Ace does made me laugh, from whipping football player&apos;s with a towel to get a ring imprint to showing up at a mansion party and being his usual manic self.\n\n100 laughs per hour, if you have a sense of humour, then this movie is for you!!!",

Hasn&apos;t been a box office hit or getting much in the way of good reviews, but if basic alien invasion is your cup of tea, you will probably enjoy it too. I liked the aliens, not your usual lot, and the Moscow sets. The cast gave decent performances as well. I would have liked to see more of the invaders and would have liked a few more battle scenes, and could have enjoyed it just as well without the 3D effects. All things considered, I will add it to my collection when it&apos;s available on disc. Catch this during a matin\u00e9e if you must, but you&apos;ll probably like it a whole lot more on a theater&apos;s big screen than waiting for HBO.",

It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.\n\nI have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.\n\nNot everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.\n\nSomething that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.\n\nFor me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.\n\nBrilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone.",

I was fortunate enough to have been a Project Engineer on the Apollo Program, and I am familiar with the technical aspects of the program. But this movie was not as much about the technical aspects of the program as it was about a thrilling, real-life drama that just happened to take place during a glorious time and a once-in-a-lifetime project. Despite all of the little technical errors, Ron Howard and his crew have put together a superb film, one that deserved the 9 Academy Award nominations which it received. I wish that present-day film-makers would concentrate on happy situations, like this one, instead of the constant barrage of drivel to which we, the movie-going public, are made subject. Long live NASA and long live courage!!",

   "reviewBody": "That anime could be this good. I&apos;d thought I&apos;d seen good anime when a friend brought me &apos;Akira&apos;, but this one is just awesome.\n\nIt has everything that one could want. An interesting plot, deep thoughts, nice dialog, hot chicks, cool action, neat tech, and animation that puts everything to shame which has ever been produced in the western world.\n\nNow when I watch anime I usually expect (and dread) the scene which will explain something about the fundamental nature of life, the universe, or whatever. This is (the only part) where &apos;Akira&apos; failed. This is where &apos;Final Fantasy&apos; went down the drain. But &apos;Ghost in the Shell&apos; shines here brightly. \n\nWhile watching it for the first time I had always this nagging feeling that some such scene would turn up and ruin the truly stunning visuals. Not so. After the &apos;2501&apos; monologue the story really comes together and you start to be eager for story development instead of just looking for the many details and extravagant action sequences.\n\nA word on the story: No, you will probably not &apos;get&apos; the story the first time around. Especially in the English version you will have to make the connection between MoFA, MF, MFA and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that is easy to get confused over. The whole storyline might not be quite as complicated as understanding some &apos;Aeon Fluxx&apos; episodes, but you have to rewatch the story to get a feel for the interconnection of the different players - especially if you are not familiar with the Ghost in the Shell literature. The story,thank god, is not dumbed down for the average viewer. This is what makes rewatching it so enjoyable. It has also some nice reflections on what it means to be human - things you may ask of yourself after the movie finishes (&apos;Who knows what&apos;s inside our heads. Have you ever seen your own brain?&apos;).\n\nThe animation is superb, and used to unusual effect. The details are exquisite - especially cloth effects and character motions. There are a few scenes that only have music or an accentuating sound effect in the background while the animators show off their full artistic talent. But it&apos;s not just show-off time, the visuals are tied in with the subject and leave the viewer time to reflect on the philosophical/sociological messages (like showing the cybernetic heroine look at tailors&apos; dummies)\n\nIn short: This is a must see for anybody who likes anime. Definitely a movie for grown-ups, though, because the graphic violence may disturb kids and the philosophy will go right over their heads.\n\n10/10",

The animation as always is wonderful, the stunning backgrounds and colours especially look absolutely amazing. And the visual effects are great too and do a great job of enhancing the story. The music is gorgeous and never feels obtrusive, and the song is absolutely lovely. The script is memorable too, while the simple yet very rich story still manages to touch me, as do the beautiful, subtle messaging and great characters here. Shizuku and Seiji are both likable characters with real warmth to them. The voice acting is excellent from all involved, especially Cary Elwes who is perfect as the charming handsome Baron. All in all, stunning and one of my favourites. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I would say Frankenweenie is the lesser of the two, but not by too much. The story is heartfelt, the visuals are distinctive, and there&apos;s a peculiar charm to it. This seemed like a passion project for Burton and it shows. There&apos;s a lot of love and care put into this film, but it&apos;s classic Burton in that it&apos;s often weird, idiosyncratic, and grim. Frankenweenie is a fun homage to old school horror movies and should be a welcome return to form for fans of Tim Burton.",

   "reviewBody": "Before people question me, yes I have seen the 1984 film and I like it very much. I was not sure whether I wanted to see this remake. Now I have seen some good remakes like Thief of Baghdad, and some awful ones like Psycho, and I was worried that The Karate Kid would turn out like Psycho or The Wicker Man. Also I saw a lot of hate for The Karate Kid even before it got released, people criticising Jaden Smith and that it would ruin the original.\n\nAfter seeing it with my family, I actually liked this. It isn&apos;t brilliant, but it is much better than people make it out to be on here. The story is very loose and updated with the bully theme still intact along with a love interest, and while it wasn&apos;t boring or bad as such it didn&apos;t always wow or excite me. I also felt the beginning dragged a bit, but my main flaw is the length, at two-and-a-half hours it was much too long.\n\nHowever, the pacing overall is snappy and the scripting was credible. The Karate Kid is also assuredly directed, while the score is beautiful, the scenery is absolutely stunning and the kung fu is amazing. And contrary to what others have said the acting wasn&apos;t that bad I thought. Jaden Smith surprised me. Admittedly I was worried, I feared he was too small and too young for the role, but he handles the choreography well and actually shows some acting range. Jackie Chan was a surprise too. I do prefer Pat Morita&apos;s more wiser and sympathetic Miyagi, but Chan does do some incredible stunts and showed real emotion in the touching scene when he smashes up the car and tells Dre the story of the woman and child. Taraji P.Henson is also credible, Zhenwei Wang is a great Cheng and Wenwen Han was lovely and cute as Meiying.\n\nOverall, for a remake The Karate Kid was not that bad. It isn&apos;t brilliant, but it could have been worse. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

   "reviewBody": "Waterworld (1995) \n\n*** (out of 4)\n\nTalk all you want about how this thing was a bomb at the box office. I&apos;ve personally never seen how good or poorly a movie does at the box office should have any impact on its entertainment or quality level. Is WATERWORLD flawless? Not even close. There are countless problems with this film but for the most part I&apos;ve always enjoyed its ambition and it keeps me entertained. The story is pretty simple as in the future all the world is covered by water, although there&apos;s rumors of land somewhere. A part-man, part-fish (Kevin Costner) gets involved with a family (Jeanne Tripplehorn, Tina Majorino) and soon must defeat some bad guys (led by Dennis Hopper) who has kidnapped the girl. WATERWORLD runs on a bit too long, loses focus on any type of story and yes the budget was crazy but in the end it&apos;s still a pretty entertaining summer blockbuster. I think a lot of credit has to go to the actual look of the film, which of course turned out to be some of the biggest issues with the production. I thought the director managed to do a good job creating a world where the viewer really did feel was nothing but water. The futuristic atmosphere also worked and the look of the costumes, ships and supplies were all realistic and fun. The action scenes were also extremely well handled and especially the ending with all the explosions and fires. The battles at sea were really just things we had previously seen in pirate movies but they were still fun. Costner also turns in a good, not great, performance in the lead and he at least keeps you interested in everything going on. Hopper delivers that crazy type of performance we all love and Tripplehorn is good in her supporting bit. Majorino is also fun as the young girl who befriends Costner. I remember watching this when it was originally released and everyone was going crazy about the budget. Everyone seemed to forget that the people leaving the theater actually liked the movie. It&apos;s too bad WATERWORLD was doomed from the start but it remains a fun movie.",

McDormand (Best Actress) is perfect as a pregnant Midwestern sheriff on the case with a no-nonsense and homespun effect with her tactics of crime solving. Great cinematography by Roger A. Deakins accentuates the bleak winterscape of unearthed uneasiness.

But it is true that maybe this story isn&apos;t exactly meant for children, although Disney tried to make it closer to a child&apos;s ear and eye. I also think that the animation was really good - much more expressive than some of newer Disney&apos;s movies that were made almost entirely by computers.

   "reviewBody": "James and the Giant Peach is a stop motion/live action adaptation of the late Roald Dahl&apos;s book in the early 60s when being transitioned into film (like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The BFG, The Witches, Matilda, and The Fantastic Mr. Fox) about a young boy named James, who climbs into the peach and meets anthropomorphic stop-motion insects and stumbles upon an adventure of a lifetime. Many critics and fans of Roald Dahl alike were amazed about how faithful this movie was to the book, but there are two problems that I do have with this adaptation.\n\n1) The beginning was quite dark and might frighten younger kids along with other scenes.\n\n2) The rhino in the sky and the scene where James battles it wasn&apos;t explained enough. That&apos;s it for the criticism.\n\nThe positive aspects of this movie were excellent. The live action sets and the stop-motion animation have an astounding charm to the book. The character designs are pretty unique and the Jack Skellington cameo as the captain of the skeletons was amazing. The acting is very superb. The stop-motion insects were good, the two mean aunts named Spike and Sponge were tolerable, and the main character James is very likable. Even the action is very good. Music/songs written by Randy Newman (The Toy Story trilogy, The Princess and the Frog) were surprising good. Although not a masterpiece, James and the Giant Peach is an enjoyable family entertainment that stays faithful to the story from a great author.\n\n8/10",

   "reviewBody": "Independence Day is the sort of film that&apos;s best appreciated on a big screen, preferably a massive great plasma television that is so huge you had to cut the roof off your house and get airlifted in by helicopters just to get it in the living room. You should also have the most state of the art surround sound possible, with bass pickups so deep they cause earthquakes on the Eastern seaboard. Not because Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich&apos;s alien invasion flick is a masterpiece of cinematic art or anything, but because it&apos;s loud. Very loud. And if the windows in your house don&apos;t shatter when the spaceship flies over New York then well, you&apos;re just not experiencing it properly.\n\nTaking the 1950&apos;s invasion narratives and pro-tooling them for 90&apos;s audiences, Independence Day is an absolute blast of visual flare and gung ho heroism. The plot is so straightforward as to be superfluous (aliens invade, fights ensue) but even so, it remains an invigorating watch purely because of the spectacle it provides. Back in 1996, the sight of that giant blue laser tearing apart lower Manhattan made jaws drop and while it&apos;s unlikely to do the same to today&apos;s overstimulated audiences, it&apos;s still an incredible visual feast. What&apos;s more, the ensemble cast makes it surprisingly unpredictable - we all know that the aliens will be defeated at the end, but what isn&apos;t so obvious is which characters are going to be alive to see it. Except for the kid and the dog. They&apos;re relatively safe bets.\n\nWatching it now though, it does possess a cheerful naivety in the face of world politics. After all, this was 1996, the Cold War was over and 9/11 a long way off, so the entire world uniting against a common foe without being bogged down with petty arguments and personal agendas still seemed believable. Hell, even the gun-toting Arabs that briefly appear on screen are more than happy to rally behind Uncle Sam in the name of freedom. That&apos;s right folks, it&apos;s an Americans Save The World movie, complete with a snapshot of British officers drinking tea in the desert and waiting for those silly yanks to get a bally move on and show us what to do.\n\nNeedless to say, this is blockbuster entertainment through and through. The aliens are apparently here to strip mine the planet of all her natural resources, but they&apos;re quite happy to put that off for a bit in order to blow things up for the entire running time. Fans of in-depth characterisation, intelligent story telling and emotional engagement with the protagonists are wasting their time, but if you want to watch tourist attractions, jet planes and space craft exploding for three hours, you can&apos;t really go wrong. That business about a computer virus bringing down the mother-ship is a bit daft though, not once did they try switching everything on and off again.",

   "reviewBody": "A group of aliens arrive in Loony Tune world and challenge the inhabitants to a battle for the ownership of that world. Seeing the aliens are tiny, Bugs Bunny decides a game of basketball should be easily won. However the aliens steal the talent from several NBA players and look set to win easily. However Bugs and Daffy kidnap Michael Jordan and ask for his help.\n\nAt the time of release I must admit that I wasn&apos;t keen on seeing this film as the whole merchandising thing had left me with a sour taste in my mouth, putting me off the film. Happy Meals and such were everywhere! Later I saw it on TV, away from all the hype and found it enjoyable but not great. The plot is silly, but who cares \u0096 it&apos;s a cartoon. The comedy is good and has plenty for kids with the cartoon characters doing cartoon things, but also for adults. The film is full of in-jokes for adults ranging from a 3 second spoof of Pulp Fiction to some really funny lines \u0096 `oh great, no one told me Dan Aykroyd was in this film&apos; when Bill Murray makes an appearance, was my favourite. Also as a big basketball (and Knick) fan it was fun to have tonnes of basketball stars make fun of themselves as well.\n\nHowever it is a cartoon at heart and I imagine that those who don&apos;t like pratfalls etc and aren&apos;t basketball fans won&apos;t be laughing all the time. Also, surprisingly for Jordan&apos;s first film, the basketball action is pretty poor. I know it didn&apos;t have to be realistic but the great man is amazing enough in action without giving him amazing rubber arms etc with special effects.\n\nJordan is good and is a better actor than others I&apos;ve seen, but he is only playing himself and not that naturally either! The support cast is where the money is and they all work well. Whether it be the cartoon characters or adults they all do what they have to. De Vito is funny and Randle is sexy but as usual Murray steals each and every scene he is in!\n\nOverall this manages to be more than a sales drive for Happy Meals (although the McDonalds product placement is a bit tasteless \u0096 hey! Just like the burgers!) and is an enjoyable film. The kids will be happy with the cartoon element and most adults will like the in-jokes and the NBA players making jokes at their expense.",

Much of the film is incoherent if you think about, even more so than other fantasias. I am still not entirely sure what happened in the end. This largely works in the film&apos;s favor because the oddness of the text fits the visually whimsy. This feels very much like an early Burton film and it has same sense otherworldly quality.\n\nThe animation is gloriously expressive. They really push the style into some surreal and dream like images. It is a lot more striking then the generic photoreal stuff that you get in a ton of American animation. I might not understood what was happening at all times but I did understand the emotion-a rich melancholy-because the animation and the music let me know.\n\nThis was a very good film.",

I&apos;ve been lucky enough to have an opportunity to see this movie down here at SXSW and I am the better for it.\n\nYou don&apos;t really stumble upon many riveting, independent, sci-fi films that look beautiful(let alone don&apos;t contain aliens and space magic) and capture major emotional themes successfully. Moon accomplishes this, and with very little CGI at that.\n\nSam Bell is an astronaut working for a corporation on the far side of the moon. His job? Maintaining a lunar facility and the automated machines which are harvesting the moon&apos;s surface for Helium 3. The harvested material is then sent back to Earth to use as energy.\n\nSam is on the very last leg of a three year contract and is quite anxious to return to his wife and daughter. Barring any incidents, Sam will be able to leave his solitude. But something does go wrong.\n\nThat said, tremendous acting by Sam Rockwell carries this film - mainly because he is basically the only person in the movie. I&apos;m not talking about Cast Away meets the moon This film explores loneliness much deeper than that, and with much more emotion as well. Luckily for us there are no pieces of sports equipment on which the lead dotes, but instead we&apos;re blessed with a monotonous talking robot(voiced by Kevin Spacey) reminiscent of Hal from 2001 notoriety.\n\nI advise that people go see this film, not only to support Duncan, the director, and Sam, but also to explore to possibilities of space and the humanity of loneliness.\n\nDon&apos;t go in expecting to find what I have discussed, but go in expecting to find something inside yourself.",

   "reviewBody": "I really believe that they billed this movie wrong. Many folks came in expecting the next Star Wars and were disappointed, to say the least. It&apos;s not like Star Wars. It&apos;s kinda like a live action comic book. Visually stunning, awesome use of color that just jumps out at you, and non-stop action, lots of it done with tongue firmly in cheek. Plot? Well forget the plot, it&apos;s the weak point of the film. But hey who ever said comic books had to have strong plots? Willis, Jovovich, and the rest do a fine job. I especially like the casting of Jovovich, she exudes innocence, vulnerability, sex, exotica, intelligence, and kung fu machismo all at the same time. So turn off the cynicism sign as you watch and just enjoy the ride. Great stuff!",

The animators have done a masterful job of producing a setting that really works. The chameleon star finds himself in Dirt, the aforementioned town, and is given the task of saving the water supply. Yes, it is a bit dark and the plot is sophisticated. So why so many 1&apos;s and 2&apos;s. Is it that people are so easily bored when their minds are a bit challenged by an animated film? This is one of the better films of the year and works on many levels. It also parodies tough Westerns that we have seen in contemporary times.",

   "reviewBody": "This movie had a lot of potential. While technically impressive and very enjoyable with some genuinely funny moments, for some reason it falls short. Of course there are redeeming qualities, such as the fun music score by Danny Elfman, one of my all time favourite film composers and an amusing turn from Robin Williams. Also the special effects are greatly improved from the effects in the Absent Minded Professor, and Flubber who is so cute steals the show. The performances from Clancy Brown, Ted Levine and Marcia Gay Horden are entertaining, and Jodi Benson (who voiced Ariel in the Little Mermaid)is a delight as the voice of Weebo, whose death is absolutely heart-rending. However the story is very predictable, and offers few surprises, and the physical comedy was better than the patchy script which in places felt uninspired. That saying some of the physical comedy has strong hints of deja vu, and is rather hit and miss. Of course kids will lap it up, but adults probably won&apos;t like it as much. The second half of the movie is more meandering in quality compared to the first half, very little of interest happens and some of the situations come across as ridiculous. All in all, somewhat forgettable, but for a kids movie it is pretty entertaining. 6/10 Bethany Cox",

My response is, it doesn&apos;t matter. This a witty, sarcastic and enjoyable film. Accuracies play no purpose.\n\nThe characters are wonderful, particularly Phil and Hades. Also, Megara provides a feisty, totally non &apos;princessy&apos; female character, which is wonderful!\n\nOverall - 8/10",

The past two movies is better when it comes to the plot, but still boring and I couldn&apos;t careless about it in this. Since it is mostly ridiculous, but it&apos;s just really ridiculous this time around. But if you want to see a dance flick with cool dancing in it, go check this movie out. I am also really glad Moose makes a comeback in this, the kid is one cool nerd and the kid can really freaking dance. Overall although the plot is laughably ridiculous, the dancing and the 3D aspects of it was a ton of fun to watch. Would have been even more entertaining if it had more dancing competitions in it.\n\n7/10",

   "reviewBody": "In the future, humanity is under the rule of a worldwide neo-fascist military dictatorship fighting an alien civilization of giant space bugs. Citizenship is gained thru military service. Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) has low grades which leaves him joining the Mobile Infantry. Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer) is infatuated with him and follows him into MI. Rico is in love with Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) but she chases her dreams of being a spaceship captain. Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris) gets into the highly coveted Military Intelligence.\n\nFilmmaker Paul Verhoeven has a trashy stylish sensibility. His love of sex and violence really works in this sci-fi schlock. Casper Van Dien is perfect as the empty-headed matin\u00e9e idol lead. For the hot action babes quotient, they have the sexy Dina Meyer and Denise Richards. For a hard nose leader role, they have the perpetually angry Michael Ironside. The cast, the style, the violence, the bugs, all of it makes a great hoot. The CG is pretty good for its times. The spacecrafts could be better but the bugs look scary. There is a neo-fascist satire to it all. Of course, some may love this for all the wrong reasons. I kinda love this for every reason. It&apos;s got the grotesque, the sci-fi, the battle action, the cheesy story, and I don&apos;t take any of it seriously.",

   "reviewBody": "Princess Mononoke is, without a doubt, one of the best films I have ever witnessed. There has never been an animated film even close to this -- I kept thinking after I left the theater, how can Disney even have the guts to make another film after seeing this? Even live action movies pale in comparison to Princess Mononoke. There has never been a film to pay such close attention to details. Watch for the magnificent and subtle flying insects throughout the film, especially in the ancient forest, where bioluminescent dragonflies glide gently around the screen. There are thousands of subtleties such as this. You&apos;d have to see it a dozen times to appreciate this film fully. Aside from it being the most beautiful film I&apos;ve ever seen, it also has an enormously powerful script. The characters are some of the the most well rounded in all film. Ashitaka especially, the main character of the film, is so nuanced that he has become in my mind one of the great characters in film, up there with Charles Foster Kane and Jake LaMotta. I would compare him to Freder, the main character of Fritz Lang&apos;s Metropolis. His role in the film is a mediator between the forces of humans and the gods of nature. Both sides comment several times that Ashitaka must be on the other side, when he is trying desperately to convince everyone that there are no sides. Peace is the way. There is a little to be desired in the American voice talent. Claire Daines was certainly a wrong choice for San (Princess Mononoke), and Billy Bob Thornton just could not hide his southern accent, which made the character of Jigo seem more comical than he was probably supposed to be. Gillian Anderson&apos;s voice clashed with her character, the wolf god Moro, a bit. It hardly affected my passion. The film was so spectacular and beautiful that James Earl Jones could have voiced San and it would have detracted little. Definitely, though, I&apos;m praying that they release the DVD with subtitle options. Anyway, Princess Mononoke is the best film of 1999, the best film of the 1990&apos;s, and, in my personal top ten list, no lower than #5, but closer to #2. 12 hours later and my heart is still beating with the power of Princess Mononoke! America: SEE IT!",

   "reviewBody": "Antz is an animated movie that wasn&apos;t appreciated upon its initial release. After the family friendly movie Toy Story, I feel like people weren&apos;t ready for something a little bit darker, and more intense. This movie has death (and a lot of it at that), it has violence, it has gore, it has humor, it has swearing, and it has alcohol in it... pretty epic huh (granted, just being edgy doesn&apos;t necessarily equal good). The movie Antz which actually came out before A Bug&apos;s Life by about a month takes the role of what ants do a lot more seriously and better captures an ant like atmosphere. The movie A Bug&apos;s Life really doesn&apos;t seem to understand what ants do or how their colonies work, but the movie Antz does it all. There are the miners, the warriors, the drones (the ones with wings) the queen and others. The voice acting itself is also pretty good and Woody Allen fits the role of Z perfectly. The animation was also pretty advanced for its time, because it did many things that were hard for that time: Water, large amounts of moving objects, realistic face movement, realistic body movement, lighting, and many others.\n\nThe nice thing about this movie is that it doesn&apos;t pretend to be a kids movie. Ants swear in it (the word b****in is used once) and as mentioned there is a lot of violence. Like a very intense scene where the ants are trying to fight a termite colony and the ants are getting attacked by acid, are getting decapitated, and dying in other various barbaric ways. The thing is that this movie doesn&apos;t cover up death. When someone dies, the movie won&apos;t hide it.\n\nThe other cool thing in Antz is that the rest of the insects in the movie are as hideous and monstrous as they should be. Praying Mantis? It is infinitely larger than an Ant. Wasps? Like giants. It gives this overwhelming sense that Z is not only small in the ant world but also small in the insect world as well. There is nothing that can&apos;t kill him (even the princess could if she wanted).\n\nHonestly this movie was really good, it has a good story, it has good characters, it is realistic, and has nice action. One of Dreamkworks&apos; best.",

   "reviewBody": "Zorro is one of my favorite heroes. He looks quite cool and not stupid, weird or childish like Batman, Superman, Spider-Man and all of their villains (except The Joker) and he has no superpowers like them, although sometimes it seems that gravity does not really apply to him. His weapon of choice guarantees some spectacular sword fighting scenes as well.\n\nWith this hero all you need is a nice story and &apos;The Mask of Zorro&apos; has a nice story. I will be short about it. Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins) was Zorro but is too old now. He needs another one and Alejandro Murrieta (Antonia Banderas) is the chosen one. Their enemy is Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson). His daughter Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is actually Diego&apos;s daughter. His wife was murdered and his daughter was taken by Rafael a long time ago. Rafael also made sure the brother of Alejandro was killed by his helper Capt. Love (Matt Letscher). And now he has an evil plan that will kill a lot of people. Time for the new Zorro.\n\nIt sounds a little simple and may be it is, but for a movie like this it is a perfect story. Anthony Hopkins who is never bad does not disappoint us here, Banderas has the right charm to play Zorro, Zeta-Jones is absolutely stunning and Wilson and Letscher are very good as the villains. With some nice action sequences and a pretty good soundtrack this is a very entertaining movie.",

   "reviewBody": "Now I must admit I wasn&apos;t sure about this one. MULAN seemed to break most of my preconceived rules on Disney movies. These included the fairytale element - a cross-dressing Chinese soldier doesn&apos;t have the same magical appeal as, say, the son of the Greek gods searching for his birthright, etc etc. Also, this verge towards realism meant that the bad guy would not be as appealing - Disney villains are camp, over-the-top thespians by rule - Jeremy Irons in THE LION KING for example. I was concerned about the absence of king-of-melody composer Alan Menken, whose wonderful songs encapsulate the charm of Disney.\n\nHowever, that said, I thought this film was wonderful. The characters were well thought out and expertly drawn. Not enough songs were present for my liking, but those that were fit perfectly with the story, and the chance to hear the wonderful voice of Lea Salonga (Mulan&apos;s songs) is worth the price of this film alone. Eddie Murphy has managed to be as good, if not better, than Robin Williams as the comic sidekick. And the film&apos;s conclusion is as genuine and as heartfelt as any adaptation of this story. The mountain scene contains some of the best animation I have seen from Disney, and the rousing score from maestro Jerry Goldsmith accompanies the action superbly.\n\nThis may not turn out to be a classic in the same way as THE LION KING and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, but I enjoyed it immensely. Go see it now!!!",

   "reviewBody": "The story of Moses is done here and, although not totally Biblically accurate, this is about as close as it gets in Hollywood. The inaccuracies are minor.\n\nThe artwork was fabulous when it came out in 1999. It&apos;s still very good, but animation has improved so fast in so short a time period that this is nothing special, art-wise, these day. However, it sure was when it was released just seven years ago. It&apos;s just beautiful in parts. Some of the prettiest colors I&apos;ve seen on film have been in animated movies the last decade, and this is a prime example. The parting of the Red Sea in here is awesomely-done by the artists. That scene also sported the best sound in the 99-minute film.\n\nThe songs in here were nothing special but they didn&apos;t detract from the story because they were all short. Regarding the story, I only wish they had gone into detail on the plagues instead of just lumping them all together. They could have had some jaw-dropping scenes with the locusts, etc.\n\nAll-in-all a fine film and a rarity: a Biblical film that doesn&apos;t offend anyone.",

   "reviewBody": "I recently attended an early screening for the film at Disney&apos;s California Adventure and wow it was great. The story is well told and gives you a good idea of how a man named John Reid becomes the Lone Ranger who is brilliantly played by Armie Hammer. Johnny Depp obviously stole the show for his portrayal of Tonto; I thought it was one of his best characters he&apos;s ever played. The highlight here is the two&apos;s chemistry throughout the film, these are two very different people who both have different perspectives on life and they were just hilarious together. My only problem with the film was the supporting cast, I thought some characters were a little under developed and not as enjoyable as the leads. I wished the villain were just as enjoyable like how Geoffrey Rush was for Curse of the Black Pearl. So in other terms the film is not as good as Curse of the Black Pearl but more superior then the Prate sequels. Go see this movie you&apos;ll have a great time, and people can learn from this movie it&apos;s got some good messages.",

   "reviewBody": "The Guardians is the type of movie where low expectations will be your friend. If you go into the theater expecting The Secret of NIMH you will be sorely disappointed with the story. Although Guardians does contain some mature themes, such as racism and war, these themes are explored more in the setting than in the characters.\n\nThe main characters are mostly vehicles for the story. Strangely, it&apos;s the supporting characters - the villains and the Guardians themselves - who provide the most interesting, and sometimes the most compelling characters.\n\nThere are no big surprises in this story. Any adult can figure out the entire plot within the first ten minutes. On the positive side, the plot takes off quickly and rarely slows down. If your kids can handle a little violence they should love this movie. I&apos;m happy to report that the villains are appropriately threatening. Metalbeak and his mate Nya are on the same level as classic Disney villains like Scar and Ursala, so if your kids can handle these films they ought to handle Guardians just fine.\n\nOverall Guardians is worth seeing in theaters and, if you can afford it, in 3D. I didn&apos;t say much about the visuals because there really isn&apos;t much to say about them. This movie is stunning at least and majestic at best, even if the plot is a little dull.",

   "reviewBody": "I will review this movie as a stand alone and not as part of a GitS universe. There is no need to tell a long time fan something about this and it might even be impossible to write an accurate review for a fan. For someone who doesn&apos;t know the 90s anime or all the other stuff, comparisons doesn&apos;t matter anyway.\n\nThis movie is set in a future where cyber enhancement has become the norm and this opens up the questions of ethics and moral. One of the questions is: What is real and what not? The body can be altered, even replaced, as can memories and personalities. What are the consequences of this possibilities? The next question is: Where is the border between human and robot? What makes a human human? And at what point is a human no longer master of his own life? This are quite philosophical questions and the movie can&apos;t give answers. It can only make the viewer think.\n\nOne other question is: If companies control the technology, what rights do they have, and what power? Can they experiment with human bodies? Do they have the right to make decisions over this cyber enhanced humans?\n\nToday we are at the very beginning of this development. Making this questions a topic now is quite important. We asked them too late when other technology was introduced in the past. (Like when companies started to control our food or our medicine.)\n\nSome people complain about a movie that is set in Japan but has nearly no Asian actor in a major role. I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s important in an sci-fi, action movie, set in a future where all kinds of body modifications are possible. This movie was set up for a world wide audience and it doesn&apos;t change the story where the lead actor comes from. That&apos;s just the business side of the business. Maybe that&apos;s not good, but we all know that the name of the lead sells at least half of the tickets.\n\nVisually this movie is great. The acting is good, not great. The cast plays well. Johansson plays it cool or reserved. She played a robot with a human brain and no memory of the past. Her new life, the only life she knows, is that of an agent. The fact that the story doesn&apos;t tell all the details from the beginning equals the fact that the characters know very little themselves. They know little about the attacker, Major knows nothing about her past. And the fact that she was reconstructed as a weapon makes it hard for her to be emotional. She has to get used to be human. She sees herself as an outsider. This is a movie with not many words. There are no characters who talk a lot. Well this is not Dawson&apos;s Creek, it&apos;s a Sci-fi setting with a military/police environment. It is not a thriller where the main character has to discover a complex secret. We don&apos;t need Sherlock holmes, the story unfolds by the actions of the attacker. The philosophical or moral questions are what&apos;s interesting, not the crimes.",

   "reviewBody": "The undercover unit comes back into action with several fine spectacular scenes . The crack undercover agent Ethan Hunt(Tom Cruise) is again called back into action by IMF staff , his assignment is a crucial mission to take some nuclear artifacts . The outfit formed by stalwarts specialists (Paula Patton , Simon Pegg ,Jeremy Renner) execute a dangerous operation in the Kremlin , Moscow . But the IMF is shut down , forcing the President to invoke Ghost Protocol , when it&apos;s implicated in the bombing of the Kremlin , causing Ethan Hunt and his new team to go rogue to clear their organization&apos;s name . Meanwhile, Ethan and his undercover bunch try to discover who set them up . Ethan and his group pursue the main suspect , Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) , to Dubai where carry out dangerous capers . \n\nThis energetic movie packs unstopped action , hair-raising suspense , exciting thriller , frenetic pursuits and lots of violence . Well made high-tech hijinks and full of breathtaking set-up with impressive images . Tom Cruise performed the sequence where Ethan Hunt scales the outside of the Burj Khalifa tower himself without the use of a stunt doubl\u00e9 , the Burj Khalifa tower is the tallest building in the world , it is the Armani Hotel Dubai , the first hotel designed and developed by Giorgio Armani . During the filming of production, Tom Cruise did the majority of his own stunts including the skyscraper sequences to show the audience it was actually him ; this would allow director Brad Bird to have more capabilities with camera angles & not having to hide the fact it is a stuntman doing the stunts . The film contains an interesting as well as twisted story in flamboyant treatment , worth two hours&apos;time, written by Josh Appelbaum & Andr\u00e9 Nemec and based on the vintage characters by Bruce Heller . Lalo Schifrin&apos;s classic score television is again well reused here , at a much higher decibel level and adding a stirring soundtrack by Michael Giacchini , fitting perfectly to action . Fascinating and luxurious cinematography by excellent cameraman by Robert Elswit . As usual, Tom Cruise co-executive produced , along with J.J. Abrams , Josh Appelbaum , Bryan Burk , David Ellison , but not the usual Paula Wagner ; in fact this is the first Mission: Impossible film not to be produced by herself . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Brad Bird , though this is his live-action directorial debut . He&apos;s a successful producer , writer and director with a lot of hits such as \u00a8Ratatouille\u00a8 , \u00a8Iron Giant\u00a8 and \u00a8The Incredibles\u00a8 . Rating : Better than average and well worth seeing . The tale will appeal to Tom Cruise fans and unstop action movies fans. The film made $693 million at the box office worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing installment in the franchise ; it also surpassed War of the worlds (2005) to become Tom Cruise&apos;s highest grossing film as of 2012. \n\nOther installments from this popular and successful series are the followings : \u00a8Mission : Impossible\u00a8 by Brian De Palma with Tom Cruise , Ving Rhames , Jon Voight , Henry Czerny , Kristin Scott Thomas , Vanessa Redgrave Emmanuel Beart , Jean Reno ; \u00a8Mission : Impossible II\u00a8 by John Woo with Dougray Scott , Thandie Newton , Richard Roxburgh ,John Polson , Brendan Gleeson ; \u00a8MI 3\u00a8 (2006) by J. J. Abrahams with Philip Seymour Hoffman , Ving Rhames, Maggie Q, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and in preparation \u00a8Mission : Impossible V\u00a8 (2015) by Christopher McQuarrie with Jeremy Renner , Simon Pegg , Ving Rhames , Rebecca Ferguson , Sean Harris , Alec Baldwin and , of course , Tom Cruise .",

There are not many remakes that are good in any respect, so for 21 Jumpstreet to be done again and done as a comedy no less was a real win.\n\nThis movie had excellent writers. Jonah Hill is a funny guy anyway so I expected a reasonable performance from him but there were good performances all around. I think the movie did well to poke fun at itself along the way, it provided some genuinely funny moments.\n\nThe movie did fall into predictability towards the end. More accurately, the movie fell into a clich\u00e9 ending. It seemed that the writers may have run out of steam. Even with that, the movie was funny enough and Ice Cube didn&apos;t wreck it with his terrible acting.",

   "reviewBody": "Interesting, suspenseful flick, with some great direction, hampered by terrible acting and atrocious dialogue. The overall concept is an intriguing one, and could have made for a better film in the hands of a competent writer, but instead the screenplay is filled with idiotic characters and ludicrous dialogue. Combined with some terrible overacting by most of the cast, and the dialogue-heavy scenes become painful to watch. Fortunately, the &apos;action&apos; sequences redeem the film, as they are shot well and become incredibly suspenseful - especially the scene with the quiet room. Some great gore effects and a fitting ambiguous ending make it a worthwhile viewing.",

   "reviewBody": "Now the professional reviewers seemed to pan this before it had any chance. In some ways it happened to the prequel also. As a fan of the prequel I was willing to give this the benefit of the doubt. I&apos;m happy I did but it&apos;s not a patch on the original.\n\nWe have here a film that focuses on another clan of Greek fighters battling against Xerxes&apos; men, except this time it&apos;s on warships, so it&apos;s really &apos;300 on the Sea&apos;. Some old faces but the opposing captains of our sides this time are the wonderful Eva Green and the less convincing Sullivan Stapleton.\n\nThe film is wall to wall action and you&apos;ll be enthralled. It&apos;s even more violent than the first. The bad thing is that the dialogue is really poor and the story not as riveting, engrossing and rousing as the first. Say what you like but there&apos;s a lot of wonderful points in the first that is what has made it a cult favourite.\n\nIf anything the flaws of this highlight just what was best in the old one. The lead ain&apos;t no patch on Gerald Butler and is outshone by Eva Green as the temptress Persian battle queen. In fairness to our new lead, he is purposely more human than the old King Leonidas, and is a great warrior without the Spartan attitude. Yet that misses out what was quite a strong point of the previous film.\n\nIn many way its a paint by numbers sequel as such (although the timeframe of the film mostly parallels that of the first). If you enjoyed the first and and want more then you&apos;ll find it here. For everyone else, probably you won&apos;t miss much if you let this one pass by. For me as a fan of the original, it was fair enough but not in the same league as the first.",

   "reviewBody": "Beginning with a crime-thriller and a fantasy film on his directorial r\u00e9sum\u00e9, it is safe to say that Matthew Vaughn may have already found his niche genre in the super-hero field despite only directing four films in seven years. His first super-hero project, &apos;Kick Ass,&apos; opened in 2010 to solid critical acclaim and a finalized gross of three times the film&apos;s ordinary $30 million dollar budget. And after only two years, Vaughn returns with &apos;X-Men: First Class,&apos; an origins story to accompany the Bryan Singer/Brett Ratner X-Men trilogy released between 2000 and 2006. It&apos;s intelligent, enthralling, well-acted, stylishly directed, and most importantly by focusing heavily upon the relationship between the two central protagonists, it does not feel like a conventional super-hero film.\n\nSet within the political context of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 1960&apos;s, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is an up-and-coming Professor whose life is drastically altered when he is introduced to the other members of society who also share the same mutant gene as himself that supplies them with super-human abilities and traits. After stumbling upon the shape-shifting Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) within his mansion, the telepathic Xavier then encounters Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender), the son of Jewish parents who were murdered during the holocaust by the narcissistic former Nazi scientist, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Erik, who can manipulate all metal objects around himself, wants retribution and nothing more from Sebastian who is now a successful and evil underground figurehead who commands a team of mutants (Azazel, Emma Frost and Riptide) to do his bidding for him. But, once his plan for world domination is revealed, they find that it far exceeds the constraints of humanity, and Xavier, Erik and a rag-tag band of young, hide-away mutants (Havok, Beast, Darwin, Angel and Banshee) who were discovered by Charles, must combine their powers in one last attempt to stop Shaw from destroying the planet and humanity as a whole.\n\nInstantly where &apos;X-Men: First Class&apos; works is in regards to its two central characters; Charles Xavier played by an incredibly affluently sounding James McAvoy and a rage-fuelled Erik Lehnsherr played by a stern-faced Michael Fassbender. Their instant on-screen chemistry provides the drive and ammunition for the plot to carry itself forward. Both characters have differing ideologies and their constant clashes due to this aspect allow the script to be brought to life. Instead of simply infusing their relationship with formulaic violent clashes, Vaughn has instead opted for more articulated verbal battles between the two characters regarding their stance within the society they are now becoming a part of. Xavier is an intellectual being who believes that humans will eventually be accepted within society as equals alongside humans, while Lenhsherr believes that mutants will always be hunted and unable to live peacefully side-by-side with the human race, his evidence for this resides in the anti-Semitism and hatred he received at the hands of the Nazi party during the holocaust. This heavy-set contradiction in ideologies allows their relationship to be imbued with pessimism, while they may be shown as friends and fighting together initially, fans of the comic books and films in general know this does eventually turn into a bitter rivalry and it&apos;s this development which drives the plot forward.\n\nAside from the script, it would also be rude to not praise the action-sequences which take place within the confines of the 1960&apos;s X-Men universe. With a modest running time at two hours and ten minutes, there are more than a few well-choreographed action sequences that would adequately satisfy any of comic-book-to-film aficionado&apos;s wishing to see this film. Each character&apos;s power or ability is at some point represented in a destructive or defensive capacity, taking full advantage of the fact that while many super-hero movies tend to concentrate on the aesthetic nature of the artillery characters can be seen to withstand from governmental agencies or blindsided human opponents, here it is shown and constantly emphasized that human reaction would be futile due to the overwhelming power the mutants possess. These scenes also allow the less important characters to show their physical presence on-screen. For example, during the climactic fight sequence at the conclusion of the film, every mutant character that is identified to the audience is finally shown using their abilities to full capacity, most notably the henchmen of Shaw and the rag-tag team of Xavier and Lehnsherr. This therefore accounts slightly for the lack of depth that has been attempted in these secondary characters due to the time and story constraints.\n\nWhile it is a very good and accessible comic-book/super-hero movie, &apos;X-Men&apos; does also contain two central flaws. The first is superseded in a way by the strength of both McAvoy and Fassbenders performances, as Kevin Bacon is constantly overshadowed as the one-dimensional antagonist of the piece. His plot to ultimately destroy humanity becomes second fiddle to the ever intricate complex relationship between Xavier and Lehnsherr, and his appearance seems too modelled upon that of a James Bond villain. He has the slick hair, the beautiful women and the villainous underground Club to boot, but Bacon unfortunately doesn&apos;t have the charisma to be accepted as a worthy opponent to the protagonists. The other flaw has to do with a minor aspect of the production itself, as the non-diegetic music, most notably during the action sequences, begins to diminish in its impact as the film carries on, leading to it eventually becoming the generic, genre-related fanfare associated with the conventional comic-book films.\n\n&apos;X-Men: First Class,&apos; is not your typical comic-book movie, it may contain certain elements associated with the comic-book genre, but by placing a heavy emphasis upon the strength of the plot and the script at the film&apos;s core instead of the action-set-pieces taking place, Vaughn has intended, and succeeded, in transcending the stereotypical conventions of the genre and has created a film which will appeal to a wide range of audience members.",

   "reviewBody": "Sitting here the day after viewing Rian Johnson&apos;s Looper, parts of it are still falling in to place. Standing out amongst this years crop of mostly underwhelming sequels and comic book adaptations, Looper thunders onto the screen, showing, much like Inception did two years ago, that there is a place in 2012 for fresh material and just how good it can be when it&apos;s done right.\n\nThe film tells the story of Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a hit-man for an organised crime syndicate tasked with assassinating targets sent from the future. After being confronted with his future self (Bruce Willis) and failing to perform, Young Joe is forced to track down Old Joe and finish the job before being tracked down himself by the nefarious mob led by Abe (Jeff Daniels). However there is much more to the story than the basic premise, and Johnson isn&apos;t afraid to keep details close to his chest until later in the film than most movies of this type, so I won&apos;t spoil them here.\n\nWhile certainly paying subtle homage to its predecessors, Looper is a stunningly original sci-fi masterpiece, vastly superior to any of the higher profile action releases this year. While certainly made on a much larger playing field than Johnson&apos;s previous work (Brick, The Brothers Bloom), there is still a small-scale, independent feel to the film, and it benefits from clearly staying completely under the control of the young director. Delivering excitement sprinkled with thoughtful themes of personal sacrifice, he offers us much to chew on.\n\nJohnson understands that a successful action film doesn&apos;t need an explosion every ten minutes, and allows ample time for developing character and story, something which will likely divide audiences. Looper is very deliberately constructed, and after the highly charged opening establishing the intricate time-travel premise and direction of the plot, Johnson scales back the action almost too much as he ambitiously juggles the many and varied story elements he has created. Thankfully, any weakness in the middle of the film is largely overshadowed as Johnson launches the third act with such ferocity that the stark change of pace leaves you breathless.\n\nDespite the problems in the middle of the film, Looper overcomes its flaws purely by being that rare beast in Hollywood nowadays, the totally original script. Not an adaptation, not a sequel or remake, but a fresh idea from the mind of an immensely talented young film-maker. In a perfect world, Looper would be the game changer it deserves to be, slapping Hollywood studios across the face and announcing that not everything has to be a PG-13 franchise based on a comic book. It&apos;s unlikely that this will the case, and it remains to be seen whether or not the film will even be a success, but it&apos;s encouraging to see that there are young auteurs at work who are fighting to craft new and exciting stories, even if we only get to see the results every year or two.\n\ntinribs27.wordpress.com",

   "reviewBody": "I&apos;d not seen the first Kung-Fu Panda film since it had come out in the late noughties, and I hadn&apos;t seen any of the other ones at all until it my toddler started watching them and I picked up 2 and 3 for her. After watching the first one loads, I managed to move her to the second, for my own variety as much as anything else. The plot sees Po trying to settle into his new role as Dragon Warrior, at the same time as a banished son returns to the city to use a new powerful weapon to seize control of the city and country. It has a slightly darker tone than the first film, because it touches on Po&apos;s backstory, and it carries itself with more dramatic sequences than the first film did (where we only got to see the power and anger of Tai Lung in a handful of scenes - mostly the film was about Po&apos;s training).\n\nThis slightly extra weight adds to the characters and the narrative, and at the same time the scale of the film feels bigger as we move into a city, with the stakes high. This means the action sequences feel like they mean more, and in return the actions is bigger, more polished, and fits well with the gravity-defying excess of the genre that the film is referencing and drawing from. It did this well in the first film too, but here it feels much more satisfying in the scale of it all. At its heart though the film remains funny, entertaining, easy for families, and with good moral messages throughout. As with the first film, the use of Chinese culture swings from mostly feeling well used and cleverly adopted, to being a bit cheap - but mostly it works well.\n\nAnimation and production is of a very high standard, and the voice cast is even deeper than in the first film, with people like Oldman, Yeoh, Haysbert, Garber, Van Damme, and McBride joining an already very starry cast. Black doesn&apos;t always work for me, but he keeps Po funny but likeable, while Oldman manages to bring gravity to his performance and have good comic timing too.\n\nIn my mind, the Kung-Fu Panda films were sort of &apos;lesser&apos; films because I always saw Pixar&apos;s deeper content as being superior to Dreamworks stuff, however this second film lifts from the already good first, and is a very enjoyable and satisfying family film.",

I wasn&apos;t expecting it to be that good, but The Iron Giant was an amazing movie, it is easily the most exquisite animated movie I have ever seen.\n\nHogarth Hughes (Eli Marenthal) is obsessed by the opportunites offered by science fiction, the possibility of an alien take-over or, at the very least, an attack from outer space. The original story, which the late Poet Laureate had set in England, saw the innocent Titan of the title emerge from the sea; here he is a visitor from another galaxy.\n\nThe Iron Giant is an amazing piece of animation, the voice-overs were done perfectly, the actors obviously enjoyed themselves, the animated art direction and cinematography was beautiful and the giant itself is just...breathtaking.\n\nThe Iron Giant is not just another silly little kiddies movie, it is perfection in filmmaking. Please, for the love of God, make your life better and see this brilliant film.\n\nI rate The Iron Giant 10 out of 10.",

(was in Japanese tho&apos;, which was peculiar instead of the dub:0) Aaaaanyway, this show is addictive and quite enjoyable. I could tell you about THE main character..but there are MANY main characters. The show keeps hopping along from character to character, describing certain events from different perspectives(did that make any sense??). This series is rather confusing so far, but I&apos;m hoping it&apos;ll make more sense once I watch more of it. I&apos;ve only seen the first four eps. The series is set in the 1930s in the U.S., which is pretty different for those used to watching anime where the setting is almost always Japan. There&apos;s some slang from the 1930s too, weird to get used to(plus some characters have accents). The dub is exceptional btw. Japanese is pretty good as well. Recommend either one.\n\nSo far, I give this show a 9/10. The music is great(the theme is pretty much intrumental 1930s music.), the animation is great(much like the style from Blood Plus),the voice acting is very spot-on, and the story is great. This is a great show,but should be noted it is rated M for mature, so maybe not such a great idea to let your little 5 year old watch it..they might be a little traumatized from the blood in some scenes. So far, there hasn&apos;t been that much blood tho&apos;, so don&apos;t let that stop you from watching the show:) Hope you watch! The first DVD is out now and more are on the way^^",

   "reviewBody": "From one of the best directors in modern anime, Belle is one of the most spectacular movies in the genre for a long time. Complete with typically gorgeous animation, an electrifying pace, riveting character depth, sweet humour and a handful of wonderful songs, this is a film that you won&apos;t be able to take your eyes off from start to finish.\n\nBut why exactly does Belle have this spectacular star quality? After all director Mamoru Hosoda has managed time and again to tell incredible stories, from The Girl Who Leapt Through Time to Summer Wars, Wolf Children, The Boy And The Beast and Mirai.\n\nNot only is Belle the latest addition to Hosoda&apos;s incredible repertoire, but it&apos;s also one of the most dynamic anime films of recent years, blending the classic animation style with timeless storytelling and blockbuster-level action and thrills.\n\nIt&apos;s a film that really transports you to another world, with the as-ever spellbinding visuals delivering some of the most immersive fantasy you&apos;ll have seen in a long time, bolstering the film&apos;s originality from what at first feels like a mish-mash of different stories.\n\nIn the early stages, it&apos;s easy to see Belle as a bit of an update of Hosoda&apos;s own Summer Wars, along with influence from Hollywood&apos;s Ready Player One. What&apos;s more, the film also borrows heavily at moments from Disney&apos;s Beauty And The Beast, although that&apos;s more as a clever homage than a simple reinvention.\n\nHowever, because there&apos;s so much going on, Belle proves itself to be a lot more than a remake or update of those films mentioned above. In fact, what&apos;s most impressive is the way in which it so effectively balances its focus between life inside the virtual world of U, and the characters who live in the real world.\n\nMuch like Summer Wars, the action in the virtual world is brilliantly complemented by the emotional stories of the characters in the real world, in this case a group of high schoolers who are living through all the typical trappings of a coming-of-age story.\n\nThis is where much of Belle&apos;s emotional heart comes in, and while the action in the virtual world is absolutely spectacular, you care for the characters because of how they&apos;re developed in the real world, with a wonderful group of friends whose own back stories play in wonderfully to the central action story.\n\nPlaying out at an electrifying pace for the vast majority of its runtime, Belle nears edge-of-your-seat levels of excitement, although its finale admittedly isn&apos;t as exhilarating as the thrilling conclusion to Summer Wars.\n\nThat said, Hosoda directs Belle with such confidence that it&apos;s a mesmerising watch at every moment, boosted further by a couple of spectacular and memorable songs that are both fun to listen to, and play nicely into the film&apos;s narrative arc.\n\nAll in all, I had a whale of a time with Belle. A genuinely thrilling watch from start to finish, the film is a spectacular combination of many of director Mamoru Hosoda&apos;s best films, along with homages to a number of others. However, with fresh storytelling, fast pacing, gorgeous visuals, riveting emotional depth and thrilling action throughout, this film certainly stands on its own as one of the most entertaining anime you&apos;ll have seen in a long time.",

It is good, it&apos;s not amazing or breath taking (excuse the pun), but it really is suspenseful and it does keep it real (if you buy into the whole notion that this space mission/travel thing is or will be possible in the first place of course).\n\nWe do have some great actors involved in this, but you can imagine that there are moments in the movie where some may feel the movie could offer more. But that would not be keeping it real. Of course there are some decisions that are questionable at best, but that&apos;s life and that&apos;s how people work sometime ... Really good character piece surrounded by Science Fiction, but only watch it if you like human drama mixed with it!",

   "reviewBody": "The rationale behind the success of &apos;Fury Road&apos; predominantly lies with director George Miller whose commitment and love for the film series that he&apos;s been developing since its first outing in 1979 is evident throughout, and it&apos;s pretty obvious that he knows how to craft a damn fine action sequence. Without this passion, the film would have likely stooped as there&apos;s not much else in the way of a plot or character development, even though Theron tries her hardest to give us an enthralling new action heroine to be revered. Aside from the aforementioned writing setbacks, &apos;Fury Road&apos; is a powerhouse in the technical categories. With stunning contradictory cinematography from John Seale giving us a post-apocalyptic world of lavish colour rather than your typical muted tones, a heart-pounding score from Junkie XL and exquisite production design work that rightfully earnt the film an Oscar (one of six) for its spectacular vehicle design.",

Sure every now and then there is a great animated film that revives the Adventure genre of film-making, but that&apos;s basically it. If you&apos;re an adventure freak like I am and you simply love Indiana Jones or Stargate or The Mummy for all I care you should definitely watch this film. I bet you&apos;ll enjoy it, disregarding your age (although very small kid&apos;s might get frightened at times). Thank you Dreamworks for providing me with a fantastic story of adventure. I appreciate it. It&apos;s been so long since I&apos;ve seen any good adventure (The Mummy was last and Indy before that).\n\n TO ALL STUDIOS I MUST SAY THIS: start making feature films like this again please, I miss them. Does it seem \u0091right&apos; to you that I I have watch an animated film mostly aimed at children, to get a film with a good plot, a good villain, great action, enough thrills, blood and emotion? It does not sound right to me. No Bad Boys II, no Triple X 2, no stupid and expensive action. You can do big with little as long as elements fit together.\n\n 8 out of 10",

   "reviewBody": "I am a huge fan of Moby Dick. I&apos;ve taught it as a novel; I&apos;ve read it several times. Its artistry is beyond measure. Herman Melville certainly knew his stuff when it came to whaling and the sea. Apparently, Melville gained his inspiration from a particular whaling voyage that produced fodder for his imagination. This film takes the fictional Melville back to the time where he heard the story of the white whale. If one looks at the book as the allegory it is, we put the stamp of whiteness and all the implications of the color (or lack of it) that it implies. This movie takes any artistry out of the story. Ahab lost his leg and pursues the elusive cetacean in the ultimate act of revenge. Here, a bunch of guys get in over their heads. They had an overzealous captain who simply was out for the commercial value of the animal. When the whale destroys the ship (they do give him supernatural powers) part of the crew is in whaleboats, trying to get someplace safe. Terrible things happen, including cannablism, and some manage to hold off their fates till they are rescued. But there is something dull about the pacing of the story. We aren&apos;t made privy to much of what goes on among them. There are the obligatory sacrifices that are not new to this genre. It&apos;s a decent movie, but a better script and some more personal depth would have helped.",

   "reviewBody": "The Hunger Games is ought to be the next big thing like Harry Potter, except it already started in a darker and more serious tone than any other young adult fantasy book films. The film did a good job executing its grit and thrills. Decent directing and amazing performances. The filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing Suzanne Collins&apos; book to life. It&apos;s not the usual kind of blockbuster that focuses to its loudness. It&apos;s a film with moving drama and has its suspense.\n\nIt&apos;s pretty easy to understand everything about this story and its world. We get to know most of it and the entire film is intriguing and undeniably entertaining. The cast brings most of it to life. Jennifer Lawrence is simply fantastic as Katniss. Josh Hutcherson is okay but does not tie with Lawrence. Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and Stanley Tucci didn&apos;t get a lot of screen time but they were good to their roles.\n\nThe movie is great in suspense and drama. It doesn&apos;t have a lot of score which makes it moving and compelling. The moments of Katniss in the arena are stirring. Thrilling music score is a great effect to these sequences. Unlike our blockbusters these days, the film doesn&apos;t focus too much to the CGI and the explosions. There isn&apos;t really much explosions here. Surprisingly, the filmmakers aren&apos;t lazy to create a non-CGI set(except the chariots). There is, of course, still CGI here but not as excessive as our modern blockbusters. The action is pretty good with the shaky camera. It&apos;s nicely shot gives enough momentum and excitement. Most people complain to that though. Lastly, the production design is beyond decent.\n\nThe Hunger Games is thrilling and solid enough. Decent filmmaking made it spectacular. It&apos;s amazing and intriguing enough to start a big series. It succeeds to become a solid and one and not a lackluster like Twilight or I Am Number Four. I don&apos;t know what else to say about it, but it&apos;s silent, gritty, and compelling.",

   "heading": "Dirty, funny, sexy, violent and unabashedly romantic: Deadpool has arrived!",
   "reviewBody": "I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn&apos;t expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).\n\nThe first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that&apos;s exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.\n\nThe action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there&apos;s a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I&apos;ve ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.\n\nThe humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that&apos;s the beauty of this character: they don&apos;t really need to. Deadpool can&apos;t help himself; as long as he&apos;s able to breathe he&apos;ll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It&apos;s a clinical condition; he&apos;s not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he&apos;s a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.\n\nDespite all my praise, it&apos;s not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he&apos;s not a hero) justice: but it&apos;s a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it&apos;s actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we&apos;ll hopefully see more of them in the future.\n\nMany people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I&apos;ve grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there&apos;s a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it&apos;s ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.\n\nAs it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

   "reviewBody": "Remember when Ewan McGregor played in a little movie called Trainspotting? The film was made after a book by Scottish writer Irvine Welsh and it was an intense and often funny window into the complete wasting of human life due to heroin. It made McGregor famous.\n\nNow, James McAvoy has no need to be made famous, he already is, and he showed he is a great actor in several movies; he is on a roll. But in this film, also made from an Irvine Welsh book, he really outdid himself, playing a deranged police inspector torn apart by addiction, grief and madness.\n\nThe film itself is difficult to explain and, perhaps, it would be more clear to me if I would have read the book first. Some of the characters I have no idea who they were and why he was interacting with them in the first place. Also the ending is pretty much the antithesis of the one in Trainspotting. Here, there is no hope.\n\nThe direction was good, I guess, as well as the general production values. A bunch of known, but usually secondary actors fill the cast, with often interesting results, but let&apos;s face it, the film is mostly a one man show and McAvoy was up for the job. I just wish the story would have been less confusing.\n\nConclusion: it would be a shame not to watch this film, even if you end up not liking it for some reason. You need to be familiar with Scottish accents or use a subtitle to get what people are saying. Other than that, great work, James!",

   "reviewBody": "Monsters University: the prequel that no one asked for, but everyone will watch. It would appear that Pixar has recently run out of original ideas and has resorted to making sequels and prequels of older more successful movies (Cars 2, Planes, Monsters U and Finding Dory). That being said, the film was actually pretty decent and was rather watchable and enjoyable. The film had multiple unexpected twists, which avoided having an all too predictable ending. It also explained many of the features of its sequel, like Randall&apos;s rivalry with Mike and Sully and the Abominable Snowman. \n\nReviving the voice talents of Billy Crystal, John Goodman and Steve Buscemi and adding Helen Mirren and Charlie Day, amongst others, this film stayed within the universe that the original movie had created, however in comparison failed to live up to its predecessor&apos;s greatness.",

   "reviewBody": "Reading through the previous reviews, I find myself agreeing with the negative reviews in one sense, but still disagreeing overall. I walked away quite liking this movie.\n\nMost of the complaints are around technical/realism stupidities, or else being a rip-off of previous movies.\n\nRe stupidities: there are plenty, most of the negative reviews are correct, but they miss the point, which is given a more or less silly premise, do the characters fulfill their struggle properly.\n\nFor me the answer is strong yes, I tend to respond to the emotions a movie is trying to convey, ultimately this is a story of loss and love, a nice universal theme that always resonates.\n\nGiven that theme, the movie&apos;s style, effects, music all worked really well to reinforce that. I liked all the performances.\n\nBe careful about critiquing modern SF movies about technical stupidities too much. Most of these have a fatal flaw that would destroy most of them. How about the likelihood of star travel? OK, you have to grant that otherwise most SF movies pretty much fall flat.\n\nBut still, the basic premise is not realistic: a star faring race, searching for energy, is not going to bother going to earth for its water, that is so much more easily available anywhere else, energy itself is much more easily accessible without playing with water for fusion, just stay with your own star, mine your own asteroid belt or gas giants.\n\nSure, it makes no sense for the Tet to make and use human clones, but given that, do we have a good story? I think so.\n\nTo me, valid criticisms are when characters, immersed in their realities such as they are, do not act true to their nature. And thus a movie like Prometheus failed since there the highly trained biology experts acted like complete morons.\n\nBut that is not the case here. In this movie we have passion, loss, and love, the struggle to persevere.\n\nPlus the drones looked really really cool.\n\nRe copying other movies: get over it. This movie is distinct enough to feel its own. I saw and loved Moon (which granted is the better movie), but I enjoyed this one for what it was.\n\nI think it helped for me to not see any trailers, and to come in with low expectations after hearing about bad reviews.",

I will say even from a critics point of view I thought it was really well done. It&apos;s not the standard comic book fairy tale, but more of an intrinsic study of the Wolverine character. He shows a lot of depth and vulnerability in this outing, far more than previous installments. It&apos;s a risky but necessary move to see him operate on a balance challenge where he really is prone to death at any moment. The humor is matched well with the drama for an interesting viewing all the way through. All the supporting roles I found interesting as well. I really enjoyed the presence of Yukio who provided invaluable aide despite Wolverine&apos;s incessant protests. I found it nice to see his character finally develop some closure after all the time we&apos;ve get to see him in all his cinematic installments.",

First, I&apos;d like to highly the acting, which I thought was superb, given the broad spectrum of emotions (and lack thereof) all of the characters were expected to portray. As a viewer, I really got to know the dynamic personalities in a personal way by the end. This is a credit also to the writing. I had a laugh out loud moment that is a rare event for me, even in comedies. Action sequences were cool, comedy was classic schtick, and that Renault...\n\nDespite the action sequences, there were a few points in the movie that seemed to drag, or wandered directionless a bit. The ending was a bit of a shrug, but a lesson nonetheless. I don&apos;t think the movie would go over well given recent uptight society, but maybe it is just the thing people need to relax?",

   "reviewBody": "After the announcement that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was getting an English-language film treatment, I decided that the hype had built up to a point where I just had to read the source material for myself. Though it is not without flaws, Dragon Tattoo is an excellent story with the important mission of raising awareness concerning violence against women. Mere days after finishing the book I watched the Swedish film. The hype train had me excited for an outstanding thriller. \n\nThe hype train let me down.\n\nI was left cold and somewhat irritated by the Swedish adaptation. A ton of important plot elements were left out, some were inexplicably added (Blomkvist&apos;s memories of the island became far too important and contrived), and Rapace felt all wrong as Lisbeth. She was brilliant and violent, but lacked the quiet pensiveness of the original character. She did not come off as autistic and emotionally disturbed, just bratty and rude. Worst of all, I was constantly confused by the extremely rushed, strange new take on the story. \n\nAs a lover of foreign films, I normally grind my teeth when I hear that America is developing a remake. However, I found myself desperate for this one. I needed a movie that actually gave me the experience of reading the book for the first time, that made me care for Lisbeth and that truly disturbed me. Thankfully, the American adaptation (not a remake) delivered exactly what I was looking for. Those who say this version is unnecessary or a rehash must have seen a very different Swedish Girl with the Dragon Tattoo than I saw. The American take is jam-packed with scenes that were either skimmed or completely left out of the Swedish version. Yet, despite being more robust, the English- language Dragon Tattoo is incredibly paced, feeling less rushed yet hitting all the important plot points. The characters have time to develop and grow on you, the clue-finding makes more sense, and the killer is more horrifying. Screenwriter Zaillian knows exactly what to leave out and what to change (though the ending, which mirrors the book&apos;s ending, could have been arranged better). Craig, Mara, and even Plummer are spot-on in their roles and feel more fleshed-out as characters. Mara, in particular, inhabits Larsson&apos;s Lisbeth in a way Rapace did not. She captures Lisbeth&apos;s silent, borderline-autistic nature perfectly. Her fragile body and alien appearance even match the book&apos;s description. She allows herself to be vulnerable, but clearly regrets it over time. It&apos;s a captivating performance.\n\nIf someone were to ask me, personally, which version to see, I would have to say without hesitation that this is the rare occasion where the American adaptation is superior. I did not think it was possible to stay so true to the story under three hours.",

This is a movie far more about ideas than people and that is not necessarily a bad thing. \n\nExcellent direction from Soderbergh, masterful cinematography, and while there are a few logical mis-steps, the writing more than makes up for that by confounding expectations more than once in truly creative and credible ways. \n\nUnfortunately trailers have many seeking an action thrill-ride, when what it delivers for the most part is a slow boiling suspenseful drama. When will Hollywood learn that setting expectations that don&apos;t match the product may sell a few extra tickets in the beginning, but hurts word of mouth and user reviews which are needed for the success of a film beyond the opening weekend.",

   "reviewBody": "This live action Disney film shows the story of Sleeping Beauty from the other side; focusing on Maleficent, the &apos;evil&apos; fairy who cursed her. As the story opens we are told how there are two neighbouring kingdoms; one of greedy humans and another of friendly magical folk. Maleficent is a young fairy who lives in the latter. One day she meets a human boy named Stefan. They become friends but ultimately he comes to see her less and less. The years pass and Maleficent grows up. Then the human king attacks the fairy realm but it thwarted by Maleficent. He promises his kingdom to the man who rids him of Maleficent; Stefan uses her trust to get close to her and then betrays her. He becomes king and has a daughter, named Aurora. On the day of her christening Maleficent places a curse on her... a curse that will take effect on her sixteenth birthday. She grows up in the care of three fairies and with Maleficent keeping a watchful eye to ensure nothing happens to her before the curse is due to take effect. Inevitably the day of her sixteenth birthday approaches and Maleficent starts to regret cursing Aurora; will anybody be able to prevent it happening or end it if it does occur?\n\nThe way the focus of the story is moved to Maleficent is rather fun; she starts off as one of the good people before the act of betrayal leads to bitterness and a desire for revenge. This doesn&apos;t mean she comes across as evil or as a real villain. She is shown as a caring character who comes to regret actions made in anger. If there is a real villain of the film it is Stefan; the betrayer who&apos;s actions started the curse. There are plenty of exciting moments throughout the film leading up to a finale that should be exciting for children and adults alike... and perhaps a little too scary for some younger viewers. The story ends in a way that should be pleasing for most viewers. The cast is solid with Angelina Jolie standing out as Maleficent; just menacing enough to be seen as dangerous without being evil. The special effects are really impressive; especially the various magical creatures. Overall I&apos;d certainly recommend this to those who like new takes on old stories.",

I switched to Netflix, searched for a movie and played one, however, eventually I was going to go back watching Cricket once it started. Guess what? I never did until I ended. Cricket runs through my blood. My two most favourite teams were at the cricket ground facing each other for the ultimate battle of the World Championship with millions of people supporting both. I was so mesmerized in the movie, I hardly checked out the score. Edge of Tomorrow took me to such an edge of my seat for long I farted almost a hundred times unknowingly. (It&apos;s quite a deal-breaker if you&apos;re planning to watch a movie with me.) I was profoundly engaged in it for what&apos;s going to come. Even good movies have several dull moments, I could hardly figure out one in this movie. Although the first few minutes got me thinking why are they trying to mix The US Army with The UK. This movie has almost everything in it. A package full of entertainment including Action, Sci-fi, adventure and a little bit of comedy whenever they got a chance to add some. The actors were amazing. Tom Cruise and Emily Brunt were so good can&apos;t expect better. The others didn&apos;t really have much to do with all the limelight shared between the two of them, however, at the end all came out remarkable. Special effects could have been better largely, considering it was a high-budget movie. Also, one thing which could be elaborated more was about the antagonist. I feel their side should have been shown a little.\n\nTruthfully, we humans are always curious to know more about them. All that was focused on were the two protagonists.

Based on the children&apos;s story by EB White, the story is funny, cheerful, engaging and translates well to the screen.\n\nThe filmmakers obviously realized that making Stuart look real was essential to the movie&apos;s success and spared little expense (approximately half the film&apos;s $60 million budget went to Stuart). The results are phenomenal - you can see each individual hair on his face, his movement is amazingly fluid and when he talks, you forget he&apos;s animated . The same techniques are also utilized to make the film&apos;s felines talk. The voices - Michael J. Fox as Stuart and Nathan Lane as Snowbell - were ideal choices and help to enhance the experience.\n\nEveryone left the premiere sporting a big silly grin and I think you will too. One note - you&apos;ll never look at pest control quite the same again.",

And there is no reason to care about ANY of it. \n\nAres and Hades are villains just as we&apos;ve seen in nearly EVERY Greek mythology based storyline. I just want to pound my head against the wall every time I see this cinematic flatulence.\n\nThe love interest from the first movie is gone and instead of recasting the part, they just kill off the character. Bobo the Owl makes another cameo in this movie, playing the role of Wilson the Volleyball from Castaway. The blue ents are gone... I guess the action figures must not have sold that well.\n\nWhen the Titan emerges (and it is the ONLY titan in the movie), he looks like the lava Titan from Disney&apos;s Hercules. The Titan shouts a lot, but hell if I could ever understand a word he said.\n\nAt least Perseus doesn&apos;t look like he came from the Jarhead Clan anymore. But he is still an idiot. Zeus comes to him in the beginning of the story to tell him that the world is coming to an end and he needs his help. Perseus refuses because... get this... he refuses to leave his son. Apparently despite having god blood in his veins he is still unable to think far enough in advance to realize that if the world comes to an end, he&apos;ll be leaving his son permanently.\n\nThe roles of Hades, Zeus and Hephaestus were really good, but three good performances just could not save this turkey from its bad writing and a dreadfully boring plot riddled with clich\u00e9s.",

   "reviewBody": "I realise that it may be premature to call this film overlooked, but with both Disney and DreamWorks sounding the death knell for cel animation, this film has yet to receive its due.\n\nFirst off, this is a gorgeous film to look at. The CG work may not be quite seamless, but this seems to be an intentional decision on the part of the directors, and it wasn&apos;t jarring in any way. The colour palette is well chosen, and the characters are well-drawn and stylised.\n\nSecond, the voice performances are great. Brad Pitt has always been an underrated actor in my opinion, so his performance here was, no surprise, excellent, as were those of Joseph Fiennes, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Michelle Pfeiffer.\n\nThird, the pacing is great. This is a film that breezes by with plenty of action and a welcome lack of potty humour. There are scenes where vomit and bare bottoms are used, but not nearly to the same tasteless effect as most children&apos;s films these days.\n\nFinally, my kids loved it. They had a lot of fun, and so did my wife. This is not a crowd easily pleased by movies, so this is really saying something.",

Also with great performances not only by DiCaprio, but also Hardy, as the unsympathetic fellow fur trapper leaving Glass behind. \n\nStory-wise, it is a bit thin for a 156 min picture. Glass&apos; quest for vengeance is sometimes lost as he utters few words about his drive and is being more or less, chased himself. The story arc of the Indians quest for their daughter felt a bit out of place and strange. We also get to see the fur trappers p.o.v. that left Glass behind and the Captain way ahead of them. Which in my opinion takes a little bit of the magic of Glass&apos; total perilous journey.\n\nAll my stars goes to the beauty, production value and performances alone!

I wasn&apos;t sure I wanted to go and see the film at first, but my mate wanted me to go and see the preview yesterday with him, and reluctantly, I said yes. Usually, the second films aren&apos;t better than the first, but boy was I wrong! I was laughing through out the whole film, and so was everyone in the audience, it was full to! Steve Carrell&apos;s character, Gru, was hilarious. I think everyone could agree though, the minions were the best characters in the film. My friend told me the directors made up a little language and did the voices, and I was very impressed, for you could hear a hint of English in every word they said. \n\nSo, if you have seen the first film and liked it, don&apos;t hesitate to go and see it when it officially come out on the 28th June. And if you haven&apos;t seen the first film, why not?",

The missing piece of the puzzle? Character development. \n\nThat&apos;s not to say that there is any lack of interesting characters, each of the four horsemen bring a very unique style to the movie (besides Henley, she&apos;s rather weak as a character), and the sheer amount of Talent present in each scene guarantees that you&apos;ll be entertained. \n\n10/10? Hardly. But definitely a solid 8 for me. Entertaining, fun, and definitely a concept worth exploring on the big screen. Just remember, the closer you look, the less you&apos;ll actually see.",

Anyone that says this movie is not funny does not have a sense of humor. I never write reviews but this movie was just to funny to see people on here claiming it&apos;s not. They just broke new ground for a genre with adult animation. Why not? I&apos;m tired of all animation being just kid movies. Easily best comedy of the year. I hope they make a sequel because I think it will be even better knowing they did something outstanding. Every character has its funny moment. I loved nick roll as the douche and Danny mcbrides honey mustard. I&apos;d like to see mcbrides with a bigger part in the next one because he is just too funny. Krumholtz as lavish was awesome. I believe it will be even funnier a second viewing. And the final 20 minutes there is a scene so bizarre and hilarious the fact it&apos;s animation is just awesome",

There are so many Easter eggs and references from pop culture it&apos;s unbelievable that they managed to add so many.

I left this movie a strange combination of elated and terribly sad. Elated to hear the music, watch the story and yet sad that Freddie was so desperately lonely.

   "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t share everyone&apos;s unbridled enthusiasm for this film. It is indeed a great popcorn flick, with outstanding aerial photography and maneuvers. But 10 stars? There are few, if any, movies that are perfect, and deserve that kind of rating.\n\nThe problem with the film is the plot. It is so filled with age-worn cliches that one could easily tell what was coming from beginning to end. I mean, you had to know who was going to save the day at the end, and you had to know what was going to happen when Maverick jumped out of Penny&apos;s window. Those are just two examples of the many obvious plot points that you could see coming a mile away. I could list them all, but it would take up too much space here. Basically the entire plot was entirely predictable.\n\nThe opening scene, especially, was straight out of Hollywood Screenplay Writing 101. I mean, seriously, how many times have we seen that subplot? Countless.\n\nThere were no characters in the movie, either. They were all caricatures, stereotypes. No depth to any of them. They had their standard roles to play, and that was it.\n\nDid I enjoy the film? Sure, it was fun. Especially on a big theater screen with a loud sound system. Did I take anything away from the film? Did it make me think about anything after it was over? Nah. Will I see it again? Nah.\n\nI will give Tom Cruise credit for including Val Kilmer in the cast. Considering his health problems, that was a nice touch.\n\nSo, yeah, enjoy the film. Sit back with your bag of popcorn and enjoy the g-forces. But don&apos;t pretend it is anything other than just another summer blockbuster.",

   "reviewBody": "Despite the dreadful title, Moonrise Kingdom is simply wonderful. \n\nSince his flying start with Bottle Rocket and the triumph of Rushmore, I felt that Wes Anderson had rather tottered off a true path. The Royal Tenenbaums was hit and miss, The Darjeeling Limited was too twee, and The Life Aquatic was simply AWFUL. I take against ANY film that wastes Bill Murray.\n\nMoonrise Kingdom doesn&apos;t repeat that error. Despite covering ground Anderson&apos;s already visited to an extent in Rushmore, MK looks at a teenage crush with fresh eyes, and surrounds it with a fantastic cast of oddballs and misfits. Unlike his films where the characters are irritatingly quirky for the sake of it, these oddballs seem organic to their strange island home. Star among them is Ed Norton as Scout Master Ward, who looks as if he&apos;s having the time of his life in shorts and woggles, in charge of a troop described as &apos;beige lunatics&apos;.\n\nBruce Willis, Frances McDormand and Bill Murray all play their parts but never feel as though they&apos;re elbowing for the spotlight, which keeps the mood kind, befitting the hearts of all involved in the search for runaway scout, Sam, and his pen-pal, Suzy. \n\nVisually, it&apos;s a feast of saturated colour and fabulous design, but - as with the best of Wes Anderson - the devil&apos;s always in the detail. The laughs come from minutely observed accessories (keep an eye on the scouts&apos; badges!) and from throwaway truths. And the soundtrack is a great mix of wistful Western and classical pieces. Definitely buyable. \n\nAnderson flirts with surrealism, but never gets Burtonesque, controlling his story with a firmer hand and to better effect. His situations might be bizarre, but the people in them are always painfully, wonderfully human. It&apos;s also a rare film - one you could watch with your grandmother or your grandchildren, with only a couple of moments where young eyes would have to be covered, and no real violence or swearing.\n\nThere is an overwhelming feeling of innocence and good will throughout.\n\nI loved it from the opening frames, and it only got better from there.",

What is great about the movie is its style. They really went all out with Yolandi and Ninja (the main characters part of the musical group Die Antwoord). Hugh Jackman is pretty hilarious as a bloodthirsty war vet, selling his role pretty well. The technology in this movie is fantastic, as usual coming from Blomkamp, leaving plenty of ideas for the imagination to wonder about for the future. Of course, Chappie really makes this movie; taking something so technical and robotic, making it human in action. He really gets the feels going. I haven&apos;t laughed like that in a movie theater in a long time.

Here we have one of the greatest directors alive (Steven Spielberg), a very big star (Tom Cruise) with a great ensemble (Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell, Peter Stormare, Samantha Morton, Tim Blake Nelson) around him, a good cinematography (Janusz Kaminski) and a nice score by John Williams all packed in a great story (based on the novel by Philip K. Dick) with perfect visual effects.\n\nIn the year 2054 murders can be predicted and stopped before they happen. If you were about to kill but stopped you are locked. Tom Cruise is one of the agents who stops those murders. Then he discovers the next murder they have to stop will be committed by himself.\n\nI will not reveal more of the plot. The story itself is great. It is intelligent, but also exciting with great action scenes. The visuals are truly beautiful and perfectly support the sci-fi story. If you like action thrillers and you don&apos;t mind they are set in the future (with some futuristic gadgets) this is your film. 9/10.",

   "dateCreated": "2012-12-23",
   "inLanguage": "English",
   "heading": "Brutally hilarious and quite messy, but a total blast from start to finish",
   "reviewBody": "I only had one thought on my mind for this Christmas: see Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino&apos;s latest opus, a Western set two years before the Civil War, concerns a former slave named Django (Jamie Foxx). He is freed by bounty hunter Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) in order to help him with a bounty. Quite quickly, Shultz takes Django under his wing and trains him as his partner. But he made him a promise: that he would rescue his wife from a plantation owned by the ruthless Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). And rescuing her is not going to be all that easy.\n\nWhat pains me the most about Django Unchained, as a die-hard Tarantino fan, is just how sloppy it all seems. I enjoyed every minute of it, but I could never shake the feeling of how messy and thrown together it all feels. Portions of the film feel episodic (the search for the Brittle Brothers, mentioned heavily in the trailers, begins and ends practically within minutes), and some scenes just seem to play out just for the fun of it. Another scene from the trailers involving a lynch mob with bags covering their faces seems added for comedic purposes, and has no real point of actually existing. More than any of his films before it, Django feels like Tarantino simply making a movie for sheer pleasure and with no outside motivations or controllers. \n\nThe film threatens to go totally off the rails at any given moment, and lacks any real sense of direction or focus. It may sound ridiculous, but the loss of editor Sally Menke confirms a sneaking suspicion I always had about Tarantino \u2013 he needed a steady right hand to help encourage him as to what was needed and what was not. I do not want to criticize Django&apos;s editor Fred Raskin, but it is obvious he is no Menke and that works against the film heavily. It lacks the polish we have come to expect, and is practically stripped of the glossy/cool texture so prevalent in Tarantino&apos;s work up until now.\n\nBut then maybe that was his intention all along, and perhaps Tarantino is airing out his frustrations with life and film in general. Django is deliberately shot on film (or at least from the print I saw), and looks very gritty and messy at all times. It is significantly more brutally violent than anything he has worked on before (the borderline cartoonish Kill Bill included), and has a very go for broke attitude about itself. The film seems to revel in how brilliantly it can splatter all the blood and gore (done through the use of squibs and no digital!), and how uncomfortably numbing it can make the violence. I know he does not care what people think of his films, but this movie especially seems like an emphatically raised middle finger to the establishment. And for all of my complaints about how messy it all feels, I was never once bored or felt like the movie was dragging itself out. The staggering 165-minute running time shockingly flies by faster than you might ever imagine.\n\nActing wise, Tarantino stacks the deck with a number of recognizable character actors young and old for roles that vary in size. Most have very few lines, if any at all, and seem to just stand by, just as content as the audience is to watch the action unfold. It is a little off-putting, especially with how important some of these characters are initially made out to be. Washington as Broomhilda von Shaft (one of the most subtle references he&apos;s ever dropped) does well as the helpless victim and frequent dreamlike object \u2013 but she never really gets to show off any of her acting prowess outside of her facial reactions. They are increasingly effective, especially during horrific flashback scenes. But her work here feels ridiculously stunted in comparison to the other leads. Samuel L. Jackson, much like Tarantino himself, seems to just be having fun in his role as Candie&apos;s adviser Stephen. He plays on every ridiculous stereotype he ever has been associated with and then amps it up to a near ludicrous state. He is frequently hilarious, but the role seems to border on parody more than anything else.\n\nSurprisingly, Foxx takes a very long time settling into the leading role. It may just be the character, but it is quite clear from the on- set that he is not very comfortable in Django&apos;s shoes, and leads credence to why Will Smith, amongst so many others, dropped out of the picture so quickly. But once he finds his footing, he does a fantastic job walking the thin line between empathetic and sadistic. It is not an easy character to play, but Foxx makes it his own, bringing a sense of style and grace that are virtually absent from the rest of the film. And of course, he gets all the best lines.\n\nWaltz and DiCaprio are the clear standouts however, nailing every nuance of their sadly underwritten characters. While Waltz plays the straight man, DiCaprio is delightfully unhinged and vicious. Both are playing directly against type, yet are strangely comfortable in the roles. Watching them act circles around the rest of the cast, Foxx included, is the true highlight of the film. I just wish they were both given additional emphasis and more to do. \n\nFor all of its numerous faults, I had a blast watching Django Unchained. It is hilarious, it is a lot of fun, and is wildly enjoyable. I genuinely think it could have been a lot better if there was more focus and direction, but this is very clearly a picture Tarantino wanted to make on his own terms. And for that, I applaud him for the effort. It is not his best work, but certainly not his worst. \n\n8/10.",

Also shows how one addiction can lead to another and how damaging it can be for you. I watched this alone, and felt so stunned afterwards, I had to call a friend just to calm my nerves. Seriously, this is a brutal (one more time) BRUTAL film. The acting is wonderful - Ellyn Burnstyn and Jenniffer Connely are just wonderful in this movie, and Marlon Wayons was such a shocker in a serious role. Everyone must watch it, for it&apos;s entertainment value, and more importantly, it&apos;s educational value. But it leaves chills down your spine for it&apos;s honesty and unforgiving lessons.",

   "reviewBody": "Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters feels like a cheap ripoff of the Harry Potter series made for younger kids or teenagers who read the books and would like to see it on the big screen. The script is awfully written, some of the dialogues were bad. Some of the funny scenes earlier in the film feel forced and the jokes were not delivered properly by the characters (found out the screenplay is actually written by the screenwriter who wrote Green Lantern).\n\nThe storyline is weak and feels out of place. There&apos;s simply not enough adventure in the Sea of Monster&apos;S&apos; and the actual quest felt a little too rushed for the audience to feel satisfied. Furthermore, the big finale near the end of the film feels disappointing and lame. Not sure about the novels as I&apos;ve never read them before, but it seems as if the gods doesn&apos;t seem to care much about their half-blood kids (Poseidon seemed to be ignoring Percy despite his many attempts in communicating with him)...There&apos;s no appearances of the Greek Gods - Zeus, Poseidon or Hades throughout the film...despite the fact that there&apos;s an issue of utmost urgency that requires their immediate attention. One could even question why bother making the half-bloods in the first place?\n\nMost of the plot elements felt contrived or questionable...they&apos;re just simply there for the sake of the plot (sorry for mentioning some of the plot element, I just couldn&apos;t help it):\n\n-Out of nowhere, Luke just &apos;magically&apos; found the Tomb of Kronos?\n\n-A powerful crucial magical item such as the golden fleece is only guarded by a Cyclops on an island?\n\n-The film&apos;s title mentioned Sea of Monster&apos;S&apos;, but in the end the audience just get to see just a monster that looks like a maelstrom?\n\n-How Grover managed to reach the island in the first place?\n\n-How Luke and his crew gets to have a rat-scorpion hybrid monster as a pet in the first place?\n\n-Seriously, if Kronos was defeated that easily, then why it needs 3 powerful Greek Gods to defeat him in the first place?\n\n-Annabelle mentioned that Poseidon&apos;s powers don&apos;t work in the sea of monsters since the sea is not within Poseidon&apos;s domain of power, but Tyson managed to heal his wound?\n\nNot to mention, the film ends in an unsatisfactory cliffhanger as well.\n\nThere&apos;s some character development in the film, especially Tyson, Percy and Luke. The acting performances from actors were fine and the film is entertaining in some parts of the film, but it certainly didn&apos;t reach the heights and complexity of the adventures in the Harry Potter series. While fans of the book series might love the film, but for general audiences, this fantasy action adventure is certainly a miss.",

   "reviewBody": "Tim Burton has tackled almost all of the genre&apos;s, and done most of them very well. So who doesn&apos;t want to see him go back to his adventure-fantasy comfort zone with Miss Peregrine? \n\nIt&apos;s billed as Tim Burton&apos;s X-Men, and I like that comparison a lot. It definitely has certain similarities to a mutant story, but with Burton&apos;s flare for obscurity and peculiarity. Let me start off by saying that I really liked the premise and set up. Not only are the characters similar to X-Men, but the story slightly resembled Days of Future Past. I love the time travel elements and links to World War II. But the rest of the film just didn&apos;t live up to the promise of the trailers.\n\nAs delightful as some of Burton&apos;s films can be, I find the unevenness to be one of his biggest detractors of his otherwise intriguing ideas. For some reason, the second half of his films don&apos;t have the same cohesiveness that the opening&apos;s do. With Miss Peregrine, we are set up with a much more grounded take to a heightened story than I thought. You certainly get to see the impressive and outright strange abilities of the young children, but it isn&apos;t taken into any extraordinary levels, until later. The second half is flooded with ridiculous and over-the-top &apos;peculiarities&apos;. That&apos;s would be all fine and dandy if the first half didn&apos;t set up an already intriguing story without all of the added strangeness.\n\nAs for the performances, Eva Green is the only one that really stood out here. She seems like a perfect fit into a Burton-esque drama. Her line delivery and presence just speaks Burton. She&apos;s also the only character that kept my attention from beginning till end. Sadly, she&apos;s not really in it all that much, even with the title having her name. We mostly focus on Asa Butterfield&apos;s &apos;Jake&apos; and Ella Burnell&apos;s &apos;Emma&apos;. Of course, there is some romantic tension, but it never leaves the constructs of a typical teen angst drama. I just didn&apos;t buy into it.\n\nThere&apos;s a ton of cool things about this movie, but by the time I left the theater the whole idea just felt tiresome. But with all this said, I would still be open to another entry in the series, just include Eva Green a little more and don&apos;t fall into clich\u00e9s, Burton. You&apos;re better than that.\n\n+Premise\n\n+Eva Green is perfect\n\n-First and second half are completely different films\n\n-Romantic chemistry was hard to buy into\n\n5.9/10",

   "reviewBody": "Miyazaki&apos;s swan song, most likely. It&apos;s an animated biopic of Jiro Horikoshi, a Japanese aircraft engineer who developed the Zero, the plane which would eventually bomb Pearl Harbor and do kamikaze attacks in WWII. The man himself was a pacifist (at least according to this film). Most of the film just deals with the man&apos;s love for flight, which obviously makes the story very dear to Miyazaki. In fact, a good portion of the film takes place in Horikoshi&apos;s dreams, where he can invent any crazy contraption. First and foremost, the film is gorgeous. Though it mostly deals with the real world, it finds the beauty in it. As good as the film is, it isn&apos;t one of Miyazaki&apos;s best. It&apos;s a little long-winded and slow (definitely don&apos;t take your kids to it, even if they&apos;re big Ghibli fans). Miyazaki kind of neuters the militaristic history of Japan at that time. You can feel some terrible stuff going on in the background, but, outside of the Germans, whom our hero visits at one point, all the characters whom we meet are perfectly nice people. I would have liked a more detailed picture of history at the time. Also, the romance that is depicted in the film, which is entirely invented, is a tad too maudlin (though it is quite nice up front). And, though I won&apos;t hold it against the film itself, the English language dub is awful. This may be due to the film&apos;s specific, Japanese setting, but I really felt the voice actors were just dull as Hell. I hate to say it, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the lead role is the worst. The least offensive performances come from Martin Short and Mae Whitman (the latter is a professional voice actress who is great on Avatar: The Last Airbender, though she is best known for her role as Michael Cera&apos;s dull girlfriend Ann on Arrested Development). I wish I had just seen the subtitled version instead (it was playing here, but at an inconvenient theater). I might like the film better seeing it subtitled. All those criticisms don&apos;t amount to too much, though. It&apos;s a wonderful film.",

   "heading": "Solid blockbuster with good mix of effects and entertainment, although needed to play to its strengths more",
   "reviewBody": "Years of disappointment and bad experiences have told me that most summer blockbusters are not the event movies that the advertisements would like you to believe; yes they are about the spectacle but with large TVs and strong sound systems being the norm now, it is not a big loss to enjoy such films in your home away from talking people, mobile phones, crowds and inflated prices. So it was with the Thor sequel. The original film had been pretty good but seemed cluttered with introductions and franchise stuff. The second film doesn&apos;t have so much of this and it mostly works pretty well although it must be said that it never seems to consistently play to its strengths.\n\nThe plot does seem to link to Marvel lore that fans will appreciate but for the casual viewer it works well enough to do the job without knowing too much. Basically some dark power has escaped and Jane has been exposed to it making her a target for some dark elves who seek to destroy everything. Thor must not only protect her but also destroy the dark power before it can be harnessed by the elves \u2013 a task he can only perform with the help of Loki, currently rotting away in a cell. As a plot it sets up lots of confrontation and this is the main thing we are here for, so in that regard it works well enough. That said, it doesn&apos;t seem to be able to do enough of its better stuff.\n\nThe better stuff tends to be the less serious material; Thor is a character and a story steeped in serious words and big Norse gods whereas Iron Man (for example) has a playboy at its centre, thus making the fun and swagger easier to come by. This film benefits from Loki being fun and playful as a villain and when he is around the film is better; there are a few other aspects where the playful fun comes in but mostly it is associated with Loki and there are frankly too few of these scenes. The fun adds to the entertainment value and while it does still work without it, it doesn&apos;t work quite as well.\n\nThe special effects are good though and if you are looking for distracting noise and spectacle then this does the trick \u2013 perhaps not enough to hold your full attention but perfectly fine if you wish to switch off the brain to a certain extent. The cast act well considering they are mostly on a green screen. Hemsworth gets the balance right between playing a big god and also having a bit of fun, his only issue is sometimes the material doesn&apos;t let him do this. Portman is not so much of a presence although she does well enough and she has good chemistry with Hemsworth. Hiddleston gets the best material and has fun with it. Hopkins booms out his lines and Eccleston is a good (but unrecognizable) villain. Support is good from Alexander, Stevenson, Russo, Dennings, Skarsg\u00e5rd and others, while HBO fans will enjoy seeing two very strong characters from two shows represented by Akinnuoye- Agbaje (Oz) and Elba (The Wire).\n\nThis isn&apos;t an amazing film but it is a solid blockbuster with good effects and plenty going on. I prefer it when it mixes some fun into the more faux-heavy dialogue and I&apos;m not sure why it doesn&apos;t do this more often but it still works pretty well if you&apos;re in the mood for effects- driven action and spectacle.",

I literally could not rise up from my seat. My body felt as though it were being weighed down by something considerably larger and heavier than myself... History had it&apos;s way with me( I am an African American woman). Thank you Mr. McQueen, Mr. Ejiofor, Ms. Nyong&apos;o, Ms. Paulson and others, and yes, even Mr. Fassbender. I am not a film critic nor a movie hobbyist, although I try to stay current, but what I am is a human being trying to understand the various problems and issues within our country. This movie is a potent reminder of why we are where we are as a society today. How man can be so unflinchingly cruel to his fellow man, especially if he looks, speaks or behaves differently, I will never understand.",

   "reviewBody": "So Guardians of the Galaxy is finally out and how is it?....it matches every expectation you had about it. Essentially, it is an absurdly fun, cheesy, old-fashioned space adventure with a superhero edge. For those of you who didn&apos;t know, the Guardians are pretty much the polar opposite of the Avengers - they&apos;re loud, brash, free-spirited, and most of all.....human....or as human as you can be being 4 aliens and 1 human. Unlike the Avengers, they don&apos;t play nice when it comes to saving the galaxy.\n\nThis movie has so much going for it that you can&apos;t really explain it in one paragraph but all you need to know is that the humour is great, the action is non-stop, the drama is riveting and genuinely heartwarming, the soundtrack rocks and unlike most superhero teams - everyone of the guardians are 100% awesome in their own way.\n\nI won&apos;t spoil the plot for you but i will say that what makes Guardians work so well is that it has a genuinely good-natured, back to basics, rock n&apos; roll approach that has swagger and style aplenty. Despite their late entry into the Marvel franchise, rest assured that the guardians are here stay and will be defending a galaxy near you soon.",

   "heading": "Marvellous musical masterpiece",
   "reviewBody": "There have been movies made about musicians, both real and imagined, from End of the Century through I&apos;m Not There, taking in The Future is Unwritten and A Mighty Wind. We&apos;ve had almost every conceivable approach, from straight-up documentary through imagined version of events as well as completely invented bands, singers, songs, and concerts. Yet, I don&apos;t think that anyone has ever managed to do what the Coen Brothers have produced with this tragic, comedic, touching piece.\n\nWhich is to essentially transport you into the grooves of an LP, Inside Llewyn Davies, and bring you a beautifully realised portrayal of the eponymous hero as he trudges his weary way through the greys and greens of Greenwich Village in a cold New York. And it is so reminiscent of the experience of listening to your favourite vinyl album from track one, side one to the final track of side two, whilst curling up on the couch with a cat in your lap, listening to a selection of melodic, melancholic, traditional, and new folk music.\n\nThe music binds this movie together and Oscar Issac inhabits the title role in a world-weary way that aches with ennui and longs for something never expressed. We follow his tramping travails through a range of vignettes that build subtly towards creating a quite compelling picture of the man behind the music. He sometimes does what we expect and at other junctures, veers off in a mad new direction. There is little explanation for any of the decisions that he does, or doesn&apos;t, take. He&apos;s searching without any clear idea of the quest.\n\nAlong the way, we meet a wonderfully diverse bunch of supporting characters, from the biting Jean, acerbic tongue and acid looks, through the snoring bully Roland Turner and his valet Johnny Five, as well as Mitch and Lilian, the Upper West posh couple, but especially Ulysses, our hero&apos;s apparent companion over the week (or was s/he?). They all offer opportunities to understand Davies&apos; psyche slightly more, albeit admitting that not even he appears to be fully cognisant himself.\n\nIt&apos;s a lovely looking film, beautifully shot and much more enjoyable that I would have believed possible from watching the trailer previously. T Bone Burnett has done a sterling job on the soundtrack, it&apos;s so affecting and the way that the songs are all allowed to play out saw the audience in the cinema in which I saw this mainly remaining seated through the end credits as well. Which brings me back to the vinyl album sensation. You don&apos;t pick up the needle when your favorite record is playing the final track, because you want to get on with something else instead. No. You let it run right to the end of the groove and then your heart fills with an equal mixture of pleasure and joy, sorrow and sighs, as the last bars fade to quiet and all that&apos;s gone before becomes a memory that&apos;s so strong and so addictive that you want to turn it over and put the needle back into the groove all over again.\n\nThis movie is precisely like that sensation and I loved it, from first frame to last. A quiet understated tragi-comedy, dark in places, and shadowy in others, but with a humanity and a compassion that you cannot avert our gaze from. Hell, it&apos;s even got a coda of a scene to be dealing with, which at the end takes your mind back to the start of the production and forces one to reexamine what has just passed before your eyes. Recommended.",

But in the end, I will look back and think of how complex the story was and how it was well thought-out until the very end. The Future Diary is one of those animes.\n\nHere we have a bunch of people trying to kill each other to become a god, using different diaries that can tell the future. This story is very well thought out but also extremely complex in its own right. There will always be a feeling of suspense and you wonder what is going to happen next. You will think, what will happen now, and after that, and after that. But every time a question is answered, immediately another takes its place to basically try and blow you away. And sometimes this works, and sometimes it doesn&apos;t. That being said there were plenty of moments when I was like, &apos;What?&apos; And it forced me to think, and question my previous answers which made the show a little bit more complicated until it all tied together in the end... sort of. Now the constant suspension and turn-around moments in this anime may throw some people off, but all in all this is a very enjoyable anime. If you are not shy of blood, suspense, sex, and complete mind-boggling questions, then this is a show for you. As I said before some might be turned off by the constant complexity and changes in the story, but you may still enjoy it. Give it a shot, and you might just be as surprised as I was.",

   "reviewBody": "Thank Goodness I didn&apos;t read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that&apos;s just plain frustrating. But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.\n\nMemento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie. This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards. The story and the direction are the best I&apos;ve seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.\n\nPlainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby: a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered; now he&apos;s looking for the killer, despite his handicap. Simple as that. You don&apos;t need to know anymore.\n\nThe film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance. This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days. Four Stars!\n\nThis review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you&apos;ll be thanking me later.\n\nPS: Only go to the official website AFTER you&apos;ve seen the movie. It too will give too much away. Afterwards, though, go and look at it--it&apos;s pretty impressive.",

   "reviewBody": "I am not normally one to write reviews, but I couldn&apos;t help reading several for this film on this site that just did&apos;t seem to understand where I think the film was supposed to be coming from.\n\nThe majority of the complaints I saw were that the film was &apos;too depressing for a children&apos;s film&apos;, but whilst I see where they are coming from in some regards, every child who I have seen watch this film (I work in a cinema) has absolutely loved it, and laughed out loud almost constantly. They are not old enough to realise the message the film is trying to convey: that life isn&apos;t all about happiness. I applaud the attempt from Pixar to make a film that is not only hilarious in places, but is also a major comment on what life is like to be a younger teenager, transitioning through one of the most important moments of life. \n\nFrom a more personal perspective, why should everything we show our children gloss over the reality of life, and try to make them believe everything is rosy 24/7? Again, what this film does brilliantly through the message I took away at the end was that life will never be 100% full of happiness, but that is fine. Why does it have to be? A little bit of sadness is necessary. If a person was never sad, they would be inhumane. \n\nOverall then, I suppose my review is more of a comment on the type of film we exhibit to children, and how the Nanny-state we live in looks to protect them from most of lives inevitabilities. Either way, what can&apos;t be ignored is that this film is equal parts sad, and equal parts what I am sure will become a timeless classic in years to come.",

   "reviewBody": "Bradley Cooper is simply one of the elite actors working today. He has now been nominated for 3 acting Oscars. It&apos;s debatable whether or not he was better than other actors this year, I will judge that once I have seen all the films, but he is definitely Oscar worthy in American Sniper. But he&apos;s not the only great thing about this film. Clint Eastwood does a great job directing and the editing and special effects are top notch. It&apos;s one of the most intense films I have seen this year and so I have no problem with some of the nominations this movie received.\n\nIt&apos;s really just an incredible story. At times the film can be heartbreaking. Almost half of my theater walked out weeping. I didn&apos;t cry, but man was this a tough one to watch. The fact that all of this (presumably) actually happened just makes it that much more difficult. One of the key scenes from the trailer begins the film and it sets the tone for just how intense it will be. Eastwood didn&apos;t really hold back on the brutality of killing over a hundred people, and the aftermath of what it does to a person. I initially thought the back and forth between the tours and his family life would take away from the experience but it really didn&apos;t. Sienna Miller did a very good job of giving us that emotion without overdoing it.\n\nBradley Cooper bulked up and also brought the emotional gravitas it takes to lead this type of film. Chris Kyle gets literally lost in fighting this war that he doesn&apos;t realize how much this is negatively impacting his family and Cooper perfectly portrayed that. I also don&apos;t know if I have seen PTSD better displayed than it was here. Of course I wouldn&apos;t actually know how that feels but I do know that the subtly with which Cooper portrayed it was very effective. They also didn&apos;t make this person out to be too much of a hero. I appreciate that they didn&apos;t take killing this many people lightly.\n\nI also agree with the way Eastwood decided to end the film. Without spoilers I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any other way you could have served the film and it&apos;s real life characters better. American Sniper is a difficult film to watch, but it&apos;s one of the better ones this year.\n\n+Cooper&apos;s multidimensional performance \n\n+Story structure \n\n+Eastwood&apos;s directing \n\n+Doesn&apos;t hold back with the top notch editing\n\n8.4/10",

I would recommend this one to anyone, and especially to couples and families with children.Big Hero 6 really blew me away, I expected it to be good since Disney is having another animation renaissance but once the credits began to roll all I could do was wish it was longer. This movie has something for everyone, comedy, action, some despair. In fact, surprisingly the only thing missing was romance, which is fine with me.

   "reviewBody": "The title &apos;An Honest Liar&apos; should honestly be the only thing that you read, before watching it. \n\nFor those who won&apos;t do that, I will summarize the elements that make it my favorite documentary:\n\n-Nicely structured storytelling \n\n&apos;An Honest Liar&apos; is long, but it has a calm yet captivating pace. Interviews are mixed up with enough found footage to prevent a talking-heads syndrome.\n\n-The turbulent life of Randi\n\nThis is a magician that can tell you his life&apos;s story for hours, without boring you.\n\n-Controversial chapters \n\nRandi has devoted his life to revealing the truth, but is hiding one in the meantime. This plot wraps around the story, and is told in a way that allows you to feel with the reason of this deception. For skeptics on the matter, this might broaden their horizon.\n\n-Scope of the plot \n\nThe scope of &apos;An Honest Liar&apos; is big, just as the life of Randi. It will probably touch some familiar subjects, from interesting angles (fi: Faith-healers). It even reached out of the borders of a documentary when the interviewer partakes in a lie himself, allowing you to consider the broad definition of deception.\n\n-It&apos;s educative nature \n\nThere are several life-lessons told throughout the documentary. What it can teach the viewer is very subjective, but there are lessons about deception to be learned in there for most of us.\n\n-The atmosphere \n\nInterviews being held seated, but the camera work is varied enough, and settings capture the atmosphere of the interviews. This is most noticeable in one of the more emotional scenes near the end.\n\n-What I disliked \n\nThe lack of action in the own footage. There is, for instance, a lawsuit going on at the time of recording, but the camera isn&apos;t in on the action. This didn&apos;t degrade much from my overall viewing pleasure, so I won&apos;t hesitate to grant &apos;An Honest Liar&apos; 10 out of 10.",

   "reviewBody": "Everyone&apos;s favourite forgetful fish, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), is back on the big screen a whopping 13 years after joining Marlin (Albert Brooks) on a quest to find his missing clownfish son. This time, however, Dory takes centre stage. Shifting the focus from Nemo to Dory for this belated follow-up is a no-brainer; it allows Pixar to concoct a new ocean-spanning adventure without feeling too repetitive, whilst cleverly bringing the broader plot full-circle by having the child now looking for the parents. Even with the huge gap between movies, there are still obstacles to be circumvented in order to avoid sequelitis. Most of these are handled with the intelligence and elegance we have come to expect from Pixar, though some hurdles prove to be too big. The story goes to very different places from both a narrative and location perspective, but the messages behind the film \u2013 don&apos;t judge a book by its cover, spontaneity can be liberating, you can do anything if you try hard enough, etc \u2013 are all too familiar. With glorious cutting-edge animation, a string of creative sequences and a barrel-full of laughs, there won&apos;t be a single audience member, regardless of age, that&apos;ll be bored; yet there&apos;s also a lack of truly memorable moments that stop this from being a classic like its predecessor. It goes without saying that Dory is the star of the show, although the range of hilarious supporting characters is impressive. Ed O&apos;Neill&apos;s cantankerous, camouflaging octopus Hank and Ty Burrell&apos;s self-doubting beluga whale Bailey shine brightest. It might not be in the top echelon of Pixar outings, but Finding Dory is a charming, amusing and thoughtful family flick worth visiting the cinema for.",

   "reviewBody": "Robert Rodriguez is not the first person you&apos;d suggest to make a children&apos;s film. As entertaining as &apos;Desperado&apos;, &apos;The Faculty&apos; and &apos;From Dusk Till dawn&apos; are, you wouldn&apos;t line them up alongside &apos;Toy Story 2&apos; and &apos;The Jungle Book&apos; for good, old-fashioned family entertainment. Yet, as this energetic, light-hearted Bondesque spoof proves, Rodriguez has the talent to turn his hand to just about anything, and inject it with the suspense and adrenalin that are his trademark.\n\nFrom the gloriously OTT opening scene (which tells the story of how two agents sent to kill each other fall in love and settle down) to the last second, &apos;Spy Kids&apos; doesn&apos;t miss a trick. The obligatory gizmos, mad villains and dastardly plot to take over the world are all there, along with a star cast all playing their roles with tongues firmly in cheek. The action/humour mix is extremely well-balanced too, with some hilarious visual gags sitting within a sharp script and Banderas, in particular, revels taking a sly swipe at his normal &apos;strong yet silent Latino&apos; image. Yet, refreshingly for a children&apos;s film, it&apos;s never patronising, never obvious, and genuinely original in places (soldiers made of thumbs, secret agents transformed into tellytubby-type TV characters - imagine Goldeneye-meets-Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory-meets-Any Tim Burton film and you&apos;ll be close). In truth, some of the surreal moments and the more graphic effects may get a little too much for younger kids at times, but these moments are few and far between. \n\nOk, it&apos;s a &apos;U&apos; certificate and you may well have to sit through the trailer for &apos;See Spot Run&apos;, but don&apos;t let that put you off. This is one of the better films you&apos;ll see this year, and the best out over Easter by quite a way. Go and have some fun.\n\n8/10",

   "reviewBody": "Will admit to not expecting much. The advertising didn&apos;t have me completely sold, was worried as to whether it would be fun or turn into puerile immaturity and wasn&apos;t sure about the cast entirely. Saw it anyway being someone who wanted to see as many 2017 films as possible, who has seen their fair share and likes films intended to be escapist fun, who loves the Jumanji premise and who has fondness for the Robin Williams film.\n\n&apos;Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle&apos; turned to be much better and far more enjoyable than expected. It may not be a masterpiece or great, but it clearly strived to be glossy escapist fun and succeeded very well in that. Do prefer the earlier film but other than the title and the basic premise &apos;Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle&apos; to me seemed like its own take and should stand on its own. \n\nCan see definitely why it won&apos;t appeal, and hasn&apos;t appealed to (though on the most part have seen more positivity than negativity), some. Didn&apos;t care for the first twenty minutes or so in the real world. It didn&apos;t have an awful lot of momentum in a first act that was just setting things up and took too long to do so, was awkward at times in the writing and the acting was far more comfortable and interesting once we got to Jumanji. \n\nMost of the performances are fine once the film got going, but for me Nick Jonas was very bland and while more subdued than he usually is Kevin Hart for me sometimes grated (though at other points he is amusing), the rapid loudmouth shtick is going to be a very acquired taste. \n\nHowever, &apos;Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle&apos; was highly successful in its aim of being glossy fun escapism. The film is two hours but once we&apos;re in Jumanji they fly by. Although the story can be extremely predictable and the outcomes not surprising, the lively energy, the exciting thrills, thrilling action and suitably nail-biting but not intensely so sense of peril more than compensates.\n\nAs do the witty script, that has the right dose of humour and surprising heart and even with the profanity from Hart it doesn&apos;t ever get too crude or puerile, and ace visual effects. Jumanji is colourfully rendered and mostly the film is nicely shot and more than capably directed. The music is rousing and pleasant to listen to and the ending is cosy and surprisingly poignant, which one doesn&apos;t expect yet it doesn&apos;t jar too much. There&apos;s even a nice Robin Williams/Alan Parrish tribute/homage touch, that is worth looking for if especially observant.\n\nDwayne Johnson smoulders in intensity and charisma, in terms of acting style it is very familiar territory for Johnson but he does it well and that&apos;s all that matters. Karen Gillen more than holds her own with the other leads, with a good deal of sass and charm (her flirting/dance scene after being taught to do it is one of the film&apos;s highlights). Bobby Cannavale is suitably formidable villain, if somewhat underused. Absolutely agree with everybody who says that Jack Black steals the show, he has the funniest lines and moments (which are plenty) and it is perhaps his best performance since &apos;School of Rock&apos;. The character interplay, which the film is heavy on, really sparkles.\n\nIn conclusion, fun and surprisingly good film if not a great one. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

   "reviewBody": "Maybe it&apos;s because it doesn&apos;t follow the typical Disney formula, but this fun, interesting, and hits on some relevant points about dreams, ambitions, and human greed. If you&apos;re looking for a dashing prince to save a beautiful princess, go watch another movie. If you want a movie that is enjoyable to watch again and again, watch this one. While character development varies, it&apos;s not hard to like the characters. Even the antagonists are likable, in the way that only villains can be. The animation style is different than most other Disney films, and personally, I like it.\n\nThis is one of those movies Disney has kind of swept under the rug and forgotten about, for reasons I don&apos;t understand. Kida is not featured with the rest of the Disney Princesses, (even though she is one of many who are actually princesses within their world of origin). This is another nuance I don&apos;t understand, and it, sadly, only serves to prove just how under-appreciated this movie is.",

There is no tension sinne you can almosy guess immediately The outcome of the move and thus are never surprised.\n\nIt is disapointing to feel this way when you can clearly see that a lot of work was put inte The movie.\n\nWish the crew well and hope for a better follow up!",

   "reviewBody": "A retired 70-year-old widower, Ben (played by Robert De Niro), is bored with retired life. He applies to a be a senior intern at an online fashion retailer and gets the position. The founder of the company is Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), a tireless, driven, demanding, dynamic workaholic. Ben is made her intern, but this is a nominal role - she doesn&apos;t intend to give him work and it is just window dressing. However, Ben proves to be quite useful and, more than that, a source of support and wisdom.\n\nGood, and surprisingly so. I was expecting a farcical half-baked comedy about how an old guy rejoins the work force and struggles with modern gadgets and work processes. There are a few examples of that but the movie is far more than a story about generational differences. It&apos;s more a drama than a comedy, and is a good one too. There&apos;s themes of generational wisdom, not judging people by their age (or anything superficial) and making the most of people&apos;s talents. It&apos;s also a movie about starting over, and doing what you enjoy.\n\nMoreover, it&apos;s simply a nice story.\n\nSolid work by Robert De Niro in the lead role. He doesn&apos;t do bad performances, but that hasn&apos;t stopped him in the past from taking on roles and movies that are well below his standards. This is not one of those roles or movies. Sensitively played, and ideal for the role. \n\nGood work too by Anne Hathaway, who is very convincing as the go- getting entrepreneur.",

L\u00e9a Seydoux, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Dave Bautista and Ben Whishaw are all great.\n\nSam Mendes&apos; direction is excellent, it&apos;s beautifully filmed and consistently stylish with extremely well filmed action sequences.

The story is kind of simple: Professor Brody is trying to find a formula to cure the people&apos;s allergies to dogs, being himself one example of an allergic person to them. The cats of course, are worried about this,because the cure of the allergy would make dogs even more popular among humans,making the cats rejected. The story turns around Lou and his dog spy friends,who needs to protect the formula and also save Lou&apos;s owners of the evil cats. Ps: The dogs have a high tech technnology to cause all the humans jealous. ps2:Ivy,rules. ps3:Mr.tinckles is hilarious.",

   "heading": "a pleasant souffle of a film",
   "reviewBody": "Steven Soderbergh&apos;s remake of `Ocean&apos;s Eleven&apos; is a stylish heist picture featuring some of the brightest stars in moviemaking today. The cast includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon from the A-list, as well as such established veterans as Andy Garcia, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in there playing along with them. Coming right off the heels of two highly acclaimed, award-laden serious dramas (`Traffic&apos; and `Erin Brockovich&apos;), it&apos;s understandable that Soderbergh might have been in the mood for something a little lighter in tone right about now. Well, he has certainly found it with this property, which sails along smoothly like a well-oiled machine, with no angst-filled messages or heavy-handed themes to gum up the works. \n\nTaking the basic premise from the original 1960 film (which featured a who&apos;s-who of Hollywood stars of its own day), Soderbergh has updated it to reflect the advanced technological realities of the 21st Century. In this film, recently paroled Daniel Ocean (Clooney) has decided to mastermind the robbing of not one but three major Las Vegas casinos all owned by the nefarious Terry Benedict (Garcia). The rub is that Benedict has also recently added Ocean&apos;s ex-wife, Tess (Roberts), to his list of assets, which gives Ocean additional incentive to take Benedict for everything he&apos;s got. One of the amazing things is that the filmmakers use an actual casino as their target (the Bellagio) rather than devising a fictional one for their story&apos;s purpose. One might think it could give certain audience members the wrong ideas. Be that as it may, the director does a fine job exploiting the Vegas setting, taking us right into the heart of casino operations.\n\nA film like `Ocean&apos;s Eleven&apos; stands or falls on the charisma of its stars, the intricacy of its plotting and the plausibility of its actions. Luckily for the audience, the film pretty much succeeds on all three counts. Scenarist Ted Griffin does a fine job gathering together the men who will participate in the heist, allowing each a moment or two to define his character and to become part of the team. The details of the plan itself are explained in very clear terms so that we rarely feel as if we are not able to follow the action. There is even an inspired use of `Clair de Lune&apos; near the end of the picture to lend an air of romanticism to the accomplishment, for who would deny that such large-scale thievery has often carried with it a certain element of idealism and romance? After all, look how many books and films have featured robbers as heroes. It perhaps explains why Tess can go from being a principled, law-abiding citizen at the beginning of the film to being an accomplice in crime at the end, all for the love of a man \u0096 and we cheer her for it. \n\nUnlike in Soderbergh&apos;s other films, we do not find hidden depths lurking beneath the shining handsome surface of this movie, and we certainly carry no nutritious food for thought away with us from this film as we did from the others. In fact, `Ocean&apos;s Eleven&apos; is all ABOUT shining handsome surface and it makes no pretension of being about anything else. It&apos;s cinematic junk food of the highest order, but, then, since when has junk food not been satisfying?",

How-ever after watching the movie it did make me a Harry Potter movie fan. And needless to say - this continues to remain my favourite of HP series. That brings to a point here.... the effect of expectations over a movie. True, expectations reduce joy.\n\nWithout going into the story I would certainly say Chris Columbus churns out a perfect pot-pourri of emotions, suspense and magic, delivering something appealing to all ages.\n\nEvery character brought to life on screen has done justice and leave an impression on you. Particularly notable performances by Emma Watson and Alan Rickman.\n\nCGI are in plenty and made good of. The Quedditch game is picturised amazingly. The wizard&apos;s chess is treat to eyes.\n\nLet&apos;s hope that the forthcoming HP series carries the similar magical touch.",

   "reviewBody": "I liked Project Almanac. It didn&apos;t necessarily excite me. And I did scratch my head a few times. But ultimately, I liked it. It had an interesting, if slow moving, story. It stayed grounded, or at least tried to, and did it&apos;s very best to legitimize time travel as a possibility, even if it doesn&apos;t do a very good job of actually explaining the whole thing. Certainly some things are silly, like explaining being able to control the time machine with a cell phone as cell phones &apos;having enough power to put a rocket in space&apos;, but these don&apos;t really take away from a lot of the fun dealing with the time travel element.\n\nThe story is pretty simple, but actually feels heart felt. David, a genius level teenager newly accepted to MIT, finds himself short on the money to pay his tuition there. This inadvertently leads him to discover an unfinished time machine his absent father left hidden in his basement. While it takes a while for the time travel elements to ramp up, there is fun to be had in seeing these kids build, experiment, and ultimately successfully travel through time. The film does a good job in allowing us to escape certain illogical elements, like how a group of teens with a fairly limited budget could create a fully functioning time machine, much less create one when no one else on earth seemingly could. David and his buddy Adam are already established as being geniuses from the moment the film begins. So, it&apos;s not much of a leap that together they could figure out how to complete the already crafted instructions and blueprints sitting in front of them. You could even say there&apos;s legitimacy to the use of the found footage style they went for. They even comment on the use of the camera, which at least shows they recognize that it&apos;s there.\n\nHowever, despite some explanation that helps solidify the camera&apos;s constant presence, the film , like so many found footage films, would have benefited from simply being shot like a typical narrative. The film even goes the lengths to, strangely enough, be somewhere in between. We see edits that don&apos;t make sense for someone whose recording and we have music play over things like a montage. It&apos;s just bizarre to see and hear these things play out over a film that is supposed to pretend to be found off camcorder footage. And these production elements aren&apos;t bad, they&apos;re just out of place and show the film could have benefited from simply eschewing the found footage style all together. There&apos;s also some head scratching moments throughout that can be eye-roll-inducing, but I tend to be able to suspend my disbelief, so it didn&apos;t bother me as much.\n\nThe film overall isn&apos;t one I&apos;d probably tell people to run out and see. But I&apos;d certainly tell them it&apos;s not a bad film. Far from it, it&apos;s a surprise in the sub genre of found footage. And while it doesn&apos;t reach the heights of Chronicle, which I consider to be the peak of found footage, I do think it&apos;s one of the better found footage films.",

When Mavis and Johnny go on a visit to Johnny&apos;s parents, Dracula calls his friends to help him make Dennis a vampire. However, an unexpected visit from Dracula&apos;s old-school human-hating dad, Vlad soon turns things upside-down.\n\nAs an adult,I quite enjoyed watching this excellent movie.

   "reviewBody": "This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :-) -- rightly so, since title character Wladyslaw Szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways! It&apos;s not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off. It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can&apos;t speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away. (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there&apos;s no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest `safe house&apos; has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman&apos;s head. Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I&apos;ve seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD&apos;s flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody&apos;s job often was), I&apos;d be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won! (Besides, the rest of the 2002 Best Actor nominees already won Oscars -- this time it was dark horse Brody&apos;s turn! :-)",

The story is of course sci fi, and hugely creative, but it&apos;s never silly, it is incredibly intelligent.\n\nAwesome special effects, I loved the design of the alien race, and their language, quite incredible.\n\nA story of hope, which I loved. 9/10",

Seeing this film in theaters was the first time this year that I have completely enraptured (granted, I have not seen all of the top films that have come out so far). Also, I am a succor for quality films about musicians, and Whiplash ranks in my all time favorites in that genre. The tension did not let up from the very first scene, especially as soon as the incredible J.K. Simmons enters. Simmons, along with Miles Teller (who&apos;s Project X days are now long behind him) have some of the best on screen chemistry I&apos;ve seen. They&apos;re connected; one cannot act without it affecting the other. The film is almost entirely focused on this relationship, and the simplicity definitely services the film. I hope people will go and see it and vote with their pocketbooks for excellent low budget films.",

First off, the cast really blew me away, each and every actor did a great job with their respective roles. Uma Thurman is a terrific actress and she was definitely the right choice to play the lead character. Thurman commands this role and you are transfixed by her in every scene she&apos;s in. It&apos;s not just the action sequences that she is great in, she&apos;s just perfect for the role all around. And it wasn&apos;t just her that I loved, I also liked Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and Lucy Lui. They all showed off their acting chops here, especially Fox, I personally loved her short time she&apos;s in the film. The writing is well done, I especially enjoyed Thurman&apos;s dialogue, the well written dialogue and the impressive way that she delivers that dialogue all comes together to make something great. I think most movie goers will enjoy this acclaimed movie, as long as they&apos;re not too conservative that is. I say that because the violence is truly graphic and very bloody, but in a strange way it kinda works for this one. I&apos;m usually not a big fan of that, but here it works. Good job Tarantino! 8/10.",

Anyone old enough to remember seeing 1979&apos;s &apos;The Motion Picture&apos; on the big screen is a unique person... most of us fell asleep. Fortunately, &apos;Wrath of Khan&apos; saved the day in 1982, with lots of action and a recycled, but disturbingly menacing villain.\n\nC&apos;mon folks... even the original series didn&apos;t get too deep and meaningful. It was the more action-oriented pilot featuring strong characters that knew how to have a laugh every now and then that got it the network green light. This is exactly what the reboot movies have been like up to now. Admittedly, there hasn&apos;t been a classic in the bunch yet, but the potential is certainly there.\n\nIn my view, the reboot films are one really scary villain away from producing a classic. With TNG it was the Borg. Doctor Who has the Daleks. Both races completely inhuman, really nasty, seemingly indestructible, and hellbent on destroying (be it assimilation or extermination) everything in their way. Boldly going where Trek has gone before, so to speak.",

Ted should run up for Governor or President. It will fit in nicely with the US presidentials in 2016 and should reveal the shallowness of modern political campaigning.\n\nGo Seth go...",

I thought Scooby Doo a colourful film, with some good direction, and very good performances from all involved. The best of the cast were Matthew Lilliard as Shaggy and Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne, and Rowan Atkinson is amusing as Mondavarious. The film is very amusing at times, especially the scene when Scooby dresses as a Grandma and the scenes in the haunted house. The actress of Mary-Jane is very sweet too. But I will say that the film isn&apos;t without its flaws. The plot is a little far-fetched, and some of the farting jokes are very silly. There have been complaints of the Scooby Doo model being charmless, but I disagree. He was quite sweet at times. The only character I didn&apos;t really like that much was Scrappy, then again I never did like him, not even in the animated series. Despite these flaws, this film is not bad at all, and I will award a 7/10. Bethany Cox",

It is the frozen era and prehistoric animals try to find their way to land that is warmer and drier. An early group of human hunters become the hunted themselves as a group of sabertooth tigers begin to plot revenge. As an attack occurs, a small infant child is taken out of harm&apos;s way. Enter a kind wooly mammoth (voiced by the priceless Ray Romano) and a silly sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo) who find the young child and decide to return it to the humans. It appears that a sabertooth tiger (Denis Leary) is helping the duo, but his motives are devious as he is trying to lead them all into a trap of other sabertooth tigers. The film is another great animated piece of film-making that has important messages for the youngsters and is also highly entertaining for all audiences. 5 stars out of 5.",

Also because it&apos;s based on a true story, what makes it even better to feel the despair they had at the end. It amazes me people would pay so much money to live an experience like that, where your life is at risk all the time. Okay it&apos;s a great achievement once you&apos;ve done it, but I&apos;d rather spend that money on a lazy sunny vacation trip. The fact is the top of the Everest is a graveyard with bodies of people that tried this expedition. The movie shows perfectly how hard it must be to climb the Everest. The lack of oxygen, the altitude, the sudden change of weather, it&apos;s all too much for a normal human body. The movie itself is beautifully shot, with good actors, a lot of tragedy. I didn&apos;t get bored for one second watching this movie. It keeps you on edge the whole time, because you can feel the courage and determination it takes to climb that mountain. Good movie if you ask me. Would watch it again in the future.",

   "heading": "Not quite shimmering inside fear",
   "reviewBody": "Saw &apos;Annihilation&apos; because it was recommended by a friend, and also the idea was absolutely brilliant and one of the most unique for any film seen recently and the trailer showed a lot of promise. Also have a lot of appreciation for sci-fi/horror, Alex Garland&apos;s previous work is very interesting and Natalie Portman has given some great prior performances.\n\nCan definitely see why &apos;Annihilation&apos; has proven to be so polarising with audiences and IMDb reviewers. Had problems with it myself and it didn&apos;t quite match up to the brilliance of the idea, but had also a lot of admiration for its brave if imperfect execution and bold ambition. It almost does live up to its idea, but doesn&apos;t quite. As somebody who has seen her fair share of films with potentially good concepts marred by underwhelming, and in a lot of cases terrible, execution, that was refreshing. \n\n&apos;Annihilation&apos; is uneven and has problems. Most of the characters, apart from Lena and to a lesser extent Ventress (there was a little with Cass but only for two or so lines in one short scene), are underwritten archetypes, Josie was not very memorable and there was absolutely no point to the man in the stuff with the affair. \n\nLena&apos;s back-story was mixed. It is very nuanced and affecting in the scenes between her and Kane, but is far from successful in the stuff with the affair, which felt out of place, pointless, came out of nowhere when introduced, was ended very quickly and never heard from again. The dialogue is very clunky at times, particularly with Anya and some of the back-story, while there are some less than logical character behaviours and some bogus science, especially the explanation for the mutated insides (beyond moronic and nearly ruined one of the film&apos;s most stay-with-the-viewer scenes).\n\nNot entirely sure what my stance on the final half an hour is. It is choreographed cleverly in movement, is visually stunning, is an atmosphere whirlwind and does probe though and discussion. It is also one of the strangest last 30 minutes of any film seen in a while and it takes a lot for me to be confused, this portion of the film was a head-scratcher for me and the aftermath discussion with my sister didn&apos;t really clear things up. If it was meant to be ambiguous or open-ended, it for my tastes was taken too far, don&apos;t mind being challenged but being confused is a no-no (in no way intended to be snobbish).\n\nHowever, &apos;Annihilation&apos; looks wonderful, one of the best-looking films seen by me recently. Some of the landscapes are pretty spectacular, as is the look of the shimmer. The creatures are very well done, especially the bear creature, and evoke a great deal of creepiness. It&apos;s beautifully and atmospherically shot and stylishly edited. \n\nThe music is haunting and ominous, doing a great providing slow-building suspense and mystery without making it too obvious prematurely. Some clever use of sound too. Some of the dialogue is thought-provoking, like with the interrogations. \n\nRegardless of any reservations with some of the storytelling, &apos;Annihilation&apos; is a triumph in terms of atmosphere and as an experience film. There is a slow-building tension that doesn&apos;t become dull, enough of it is thought-provoking, tense and emotional and there is a subtle tension. Two scenes stand out, and are two of the most disturbing scenes of any film in a long time. One was with the mutated insides, word of warning- don&apos;t watch this while eating, being someone who made that mistake. The other was the second bear attack, a creepy build up then crescendoing in a way that was unnerving and truly frightening. The film is also thematically interesting, familiar themes in both the genre and in Garland&apos;s previous work but built on a grander level.\n\nMost of the acting was good, especially the astonishing Natalie Portman giving one of her better performances since &apos;Black Swan&apos;. Oscar Isaac and Jennifer Jason Leigh are the best in support and Gina Rodriguez fares quite well. Tessa Thompson is too underused to make an impression and her character too bland. Garland directs with great skill.\n\nOverall, not quite brilliant and sometimes frustrating but ambitious, admirable and interesting. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

It did put me off seeing it, but when I eventually decided to do so, I am glad I did. I thought Lilo and Stitch a warm and entertaining film, with beautiful animation with the Hawiian coast. The characters were engaging and funny, especially Jumbaa(wonderful voice work from David Ogden Stiers, in fact all the voice work was terrific, the other standout being Tia Carrere) and Pleakley. Their scenes were hilarious, like Pleakley getting bitten by mosquitoes. This is all helped by a superb script, that mixes hilarious and poignant brilliantly. The music is lovely and quite nostalgic. I thought I would never say that, but it honestly does add to the sense of fun. Both Lilo and Stitch are engaging, and there are plenty of bonding scenes with them together, that makes the film often moving(I was genuinely touched by Lilo telling Stitch about her parents and the significance of the Ugly Duckling story). I have two criticisms with the movie, and they are that at times it is a bit slow, and the climax is a tad rushed. But both flaws are redeemed by the film&apos;s good nature, emotional heart and spirit. I will award Lilo and Stitch an 8/10, for entertainment and warmth. Bethany Cox",

   "reviewBody": "It&apos;s got a solid story with strong acting and a great cast. It has good humour, plenty of violence, bad language, stunning cinematography and perfect pacing. I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie; I avoided it at the time of release as I dismissed it, under the opinion that I wouldn&apos;t enjoy it. However, it was impossible to avoid the glowing reviews, so I went into watching this movie intrigued if it would live up to its reputation. \n\nFirst off, the casting and character selection is very impressive, Colin Firth in particular shows us again his splendid acting abilities. He is the perfect choice for the role he played, in my opinion. The lead character, who the story focuses around - Eggsy (played by Taron Egerton), does a good job playing his character, although I personally found him very irritating. He plays a young chavvy youth, making the transition from street kid to secret agent. He brings the urban language, attitude and temperament to the service which is very out of place but necessary for the story. Samuel L Jackson plays the bad guy very well. The quirkiness and style portrayed is fun to see and fits the style of the movie well. Michael Caine, Mark Strong and all the other supporting cast don&apos;t feel out of place (if not a little stereotypical from some of them), they still do a notable job.\n\nIt is refreshing to see a movie of this genre so well made with a strong cast, not hold back when it comes to violence. The violence in the movie is one of the most inspiring aspects, it isn&apos;t over the top and you never feel like it has gone &apos;too far&apos; but it is certainly more graphic than your average mainstream movie of this genre. There is a church scene in particular which stands out for me, it has a perfectly choreographed, one camera shot, fluid moving scene which is simply perfect. It&apos;s violent, with some surprisingly fresh martial arts and a cool choice of music to go with it!\n\nKingsman: The Secret Service is different to your usual run of the mill spy movie. It&apos;s hard to explain until you watch it, but it&apos;s got a certain spin on it, it&apos;s quirky, funny and makes many references to other spy movies and how this is a parody. Not in the sense of Austin Powers but it does make tongue in cheek references to James Bond, with some striking similarities. It has style, a fun and quirk edge and it is beautifully made with a plausible run time of just under 2 hours. Believe the hype and give this movie a watch. It&apos;s definitely worth your time!\n\n8/10\n\nP.S. The outrage that seems to have swept the internet over the very last scene (so much so, that some versions of this movie have the scene removed) is nothing short of ridiculous. It&apos;s political correctness gone mad.",

   "reviewBody": "&apos;La Grande Illusion&apos; is one of those films that reaffirm a film lover&apos;s belief that cinema as an art form can be used by filmmakers to bring people together. \n\nThe screenplay for the film written by Renoir and Charles Spaak is extremely deep and multi layered. Although the film is set during the WW1 era, the timing of the making and release of the film is very important. This was released when the Nazi party in Germany was becoming more and more powerful and another global war was imminent. I can&apos;t help but think that this film was Renoir&apos;s attempt to make people stray away from the extremism that they were getting influenced by. Although it didn&apos;t achieve its intended objective, one can&apos;t help but admire the artist&apos;s intentions.\n\nIf one has to summarise &apos;La Grande Illusion&apos; in one phrase, I think the phrase to be used is &apos;the power of humanism&apos;. Renoir loves every single character in the film. Not just the French soldiers, even the German soldiers get treated with respect. The Germans are not stereotypical caricatures as is found in some other films of this era. The German officers treat their French prisoners with kindness. This shows Renoir understood that there were ordinary, innocent German people who were caught in the middle of the wars being instigated by the politicians in power. \n\nApart from underlining the humanism and the similarity between the soldiers on all sides, the film also works on other themes. The film explores the changing times. We see the men who have been detached from the outside world due to the war feel surprised when they hear that women are keeping their hair short. One of them equates this appearance with the appearance of a boy. This is clearly Renoir commenting upon the progress women were making at the time in trying to gain equality. We also get the angle of the changing nature of the class distinctions. Rauffenstein and Boeldieu belonged to the higher classes. They understand and respect each other even though they belong to Germany and France respectively. We see them reminisce about the old times and talk about how they feel out of place in a fast changing world where the class distinctions are getting distorted as they embark on an era where people belonging to lower classes as well as Jews will be equal to them. We also get a subtle introspection on the concept of masculinity in this changing society. \n\nRenoir through his visuals shows how all the characters are at times literally and at times thematically trapped by the war. We get his signature shots of frames within frame to metaphorically imply that the characters are trapped. Every character, be it French or German is trapped mentally and physically by the war. Even a high officer like Rauffenstein feels trapped in his claustrophobic chamber. They are all detached from the outside world. They want freedom, but are apprehensive about whether they will be ready for what awaits them on the outside once they get their &apos;freedom&apos;. This internal apprehension of not being ready to live on the outside reminded me of &apos;The Shawshank Redemption&apos;. \n\nLike Powell & Pressburger did with &apos;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&apos;, Renoir is bidding farewell to an era where even wars were fought with a gentlemanly attitude. Although he does touch upon the class distinctions and some other aspects that plagued that earlier era, but he is primarily concerned with the humanism of that characters. So, we see the kindness between soldiers belonging to different nations. This can lead to a a criticism that the film is a bit overly romanticised and is a bit of a wish fulfillment exercise as it doesn&apos;t depict the brutalities of war. But I think a brutally real account of WW1 was never Renoir&apos;s vision. In the midst of the rise of the Nazi Party and the huge possibility of another war, he wanted to make a film that makes the viewers renounce extremism and in the process instill the spirit of a unified Europe, no matter how unrealistic it may seem. This is why I think &apos;La Grande Illusion&apos; will work brilliantly as a double feature with Kubrick&apos;s &apos;Paths of Glory&apos;. While the first shows soldiers from different nations treating each other with kindness, the latter shows French officers being monstrously merciless to their own French colleagues.\n\nRenoir&apos;s visual style is beyond impressive. He uses very little editing in most scenes, instead he constantly keeps moving the camera to reveal other characters in the room or to reveal new parts of the interior which were earlier not visible in the frame. He also uses deep focus effectively to make the visual language of the film very character-inclusive in the sense that all the characters find importance in a scene. This inclusive nature of his style executed by tracking shots is epitomised by the famous scene involving the singing of &apos;La Marseillaise&apos;, a scene where he practically uses no cuts.\n\nPerformance wise, I&apos;ll give special mention to Jean Gabin, Erich von Stroheim and Pierre Fresnay. \n\n&apos;La Grande Illusion&apos; is a film that I can watch over and over again and get something new out of it on each viewing. It is rich in humanism, thematic depth and Renoir&apos;s brilliant directorial skills. The title of the film itself is layered and open to many interpretations. What was the grand illusion? Is it the illusion that one can achieve freedom from the suffering by escaping from prison camps or is it the illusion that the world that awaits these soldiers after the war ends will be the same as the one that they left behind? Or is war itself the grand illusion that creates barriers between human beings who are all the same, but get divided based on geographical borders? Maybe it is one of them, maybe it is all of them.",

   "reviewBody": "From the studio that brought you Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen & Big Hero 6, Zootopia surfaces as a highly original, incredibly refreshing, thoroughly engaging, surprisingly timely & delightfully subversive beast fable about prejudice & stereotype that not only marks a new creative high for Disney but is arguably the finest film that this legendary animation studio has come up with in their Revival Era, so far.\n\nSet in a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, the story of Zootopia takes place in the titular metropolis and follows a bunny cop named Judy Hopps who, despite her par excellent performance in the class, is assigned parking duty by her superior. But when she volunteers to undertake a missing-predator case, she is given 48 hours to solve the mystery or resign, following which she blackmails a sly fox into helping her, and uncovers a sinister conspiracy.\n\nCo-directed by Byron Howard & Rich Moore, the duo put up an intriguing world on the screen that does have a fresh quality but there is still a deep sense of familiarity to it. However, where the two leave a lasting impression is in finding that perfect balance between its consistently gripping storyline & moments of pure hilarity. The writing staff also deserves a mention, for their screenplay brims with numerous pop culture references, parodies many renowned classics & handles its topical themes with care.\n\nThe 3D animation is absolutely top-notch, for the images retain its crispness, clarity & vibrancy from beginning to end. The animators put up a vast number of characters on the screen, ranging from the largest elephant to the smallest shrew, yet they are all given a well-defined arc. Cinematography further enhances the overall look n feel of the story with its fluid camera-work, splendid use of colour palette & spot-on lighting. Editing provides just enough screen time to all the relevant characters while moving the plot forward at a blistering pace.\n\nThe cast is wisely chosen, and all the actors do a competent job in lending their voice & soul to the mammals they play. Ginnifer Goodwin brings a bubbly side to the new cop in town and confidently plays her role. Jason Bateman plays his part with finesse plus his voice really fits his cynical con artist character. Also, the chemistry between the two is a highlight in itself. Michael Giacchino&apos;s ebullient score seamlessly blends in & compliments the narrative while Shakira beautifully wraps everything up with a catchy, uplifting & wonderful song that smartly summarises its themes & message.\n\nOn an overall scale, Zootopia finds Disney stepping out of its comfort zone to tackle a bold, ambitious & risky project, and it is one gamble that pays off tremendously well in the studio&apos;s favour. Also, its arrival couldn&apos;t have been better, considering how its elements of prejudice & stereotypes mirror the racial hostilities present in our very own current social environment. An ingenious blend of sophisticated storytelling, jubilant humour & thought-provoking themes that amazes, entertains & enlightens without ever compromising with the fun factor, Zootopia is a definite delight for viewers of all ages, and is undoubtedly the best film of the year, so far. Strongly recommended.",

He made the movie with his one-liners. Casting was very good. Special effects were incredible. I would give it 9 out of 10 stars. I hope there is a sequel to follow this movie. There appeared to be a time span between Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick but they bridged the gap quite well. A prequel to Pitch Black would help to establish who Riddick is and where he came from. This movie definitely took me to a place few science fiction movies do now days. I predict that Riddick will be entertaining us with more movies in the future.",

   "reviewBody": "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the very first animated film featured by Disney and one of the most charming. While it&apos;s a bit different from the original fairy tale, Walt Disney took this familiar classic and turned into a family film that is still talked about over 60 years later. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is such a charming film and is another example of beautiful animation and a terrific story that could charm it&apos;s way into your heart. I still enjoy watching this film to this day, who could love the seven dwarfs? They all were so funny to watch and are so memorable. They pretty much represent our moods, they&apos;re kinda like a mood ring that&apos;s put into one room, lol. But Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the perfect family film that is still holding up very well all these years.\n\nSnow White is a lovely princess who one day is just traveling through the forest. She comes across a house where it&apos;s a total mess, she decides to clean it as a favor to those who are living there. It turns out that seven dwarfs live there and when they find her, they realize they got a good thing going here, a hot girl who&apos;ll clean for them. But not everything is happy, the evil wicked queen wants to be the fairest in the land and Snow White has just beat her by a land slide. So she disguises herself as a witch and offers Snow White an apple, she eats it, and dies. Now the queen&apos;s the hottest girl in town, but the dwarfs come up with a clever plan to get her true love, the prince, he must kill the queen and save Snow White so they could live happily ever after.\n\nI&apos;d say that&apos;s a nice summary, I try my best anyways. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is just one of the greatest Disney films ever made. It&apos;s such a charming film and is very much apart of our pop culture today and as far as films go, this is just a great one. I can&apos;t wait to show this to my kids one day, they&apos;ll probably laugh thinking how old this movie is that it&apos;s hand drawn, but I think that&apos;s what makes it so special. The voices, the songs, the animation, everything about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was just beautiful. I highly recommend this, it&apos;s a great family film.\n\n10/10",

From this point to the end, you laugh many times. Plot is a bit absurd, but it is what you expect about it, as it is a comedy, a parody of another films. Johnny Depp plays a role which is very similar to what we&apos;ve seen before in another films, but that doesn&apos;t impede you to laugh with him. I would like to highlight the role Paul Bettany plays. He is the center of most of the funny situations of the film, with some quotes you will repeat even after the end of the film. As a summary, I have to say that it&apos;s not an incredible film, but you&apos;ll have a fantastic time in the cinema if you chooses it.",

It manages to use the animation to create and rationalize images, worlds, characters and concepts so complicated and imaginative that usually can only find their form inside minds. But at the same time narratively it feels rushed and this makes it hard to be involved, moved and you find yourself detached; so many aspects about the main character, the dimensions he cross and about the philosophy behind them and the main story needed more attention, a more elaborated development, especially in the first half where the movie don&apos;t find the right rhythm running and running without a breath, a beautiful, essential breath. Maybe it just needs to be watched a second time or even more to be fully appreciated. Still it really is a good movie, even a masterpiece under some aspects as already mantioned, but it could have been a masterpiece under every aspect if it lasted longer. It had so much to say and too little time to do it.",

There are less Quidditch matches, and more menace, in keeping with the improved complexity of Rowling&apos;s third novel. Hogwarts is not safe, Draco Malfoy is no longer a menace, but just a pain in the ass. And the new CGI-scripted character Buckbeak the Hippogriff (half eagle, half horse) looks fantastic and has personality.The kids are all supposed to be thirteen but look older - hey we&apos;ll forgive them. Neville Longbottom has lost so much weight he&apos;s almost unrecognisable.\n\nGreat performances from Emma Thompson hamming it up as the ditsy professor of foretelling, Prof Trelawny, Michael Gambon as the new Professor Dumbledore (not as magical but good), David Thewliss as Prof Lupin, and Gary Oldman as the Prisoner of Azkhaban.Thrilling, complex, menacing, ****/***** stars.",

Someone not familiar with the story may well be baffled by the movie. Those who have read the book will recognize the plot up to close to the end, where the movie veers off in its own attempt for a resolution that Lem did not seem to think necessary to provide in the novel.\n\nI was disappointed that the movie had almost nothing to say or show about the sentient ocean of Solaris and humanity&apos;s failure to comprehend it. The book went into great detail in describing the fantastic phenomena of the ocean and the various failed theories to explain them. In fact I think that was the central theme of the book which is almost completely lost in the movie.",

There is never a dull moment while watching this film. I guess that is obvious by the overwhelming success at the box office. Working at a movie theater I get to see the reactions of our patrons after seeing each film we show; Cars is a must see this summer. There are very few genuine family movies released now a days, this is a clean movie that families can come together and enjoy without worrying about having to screen the film before bringing the kids. I recommend everyone go see this film and then go see it again.",

   "heading": "so close... if it had been 10 minutes shorter it would have been a 10!",
   "reviewBody": "Fantasia is so educational, and I was gob smacked by how well the animation mixed with the classical music. Can I also say that Leopold Stokowski is one of the best conductor of the 20th century, right on a parallel with Herbert Von Karajan? I was listening to Sibelius&apos;s 5th symphony a few years back, and he conducted it the year before he died, and he was in his 90s. Not only that, but that was the best version of that symphony I had ever heard. Back to Fantasia then. Each piece was expertly introduced by Deems Taylor, and unlike its sequel didn&apos;t take too long.(Even the soundtrack vignette was interesting) In the sequel, almost half of the film felt like too much introduction and not enough music. Fantasia rectified that problem brilliantly: \n\n1. Bach&apos;s Toccata- Brilliant silhouettes of the orchestra, and then masterful abstract images. The orchestra played the piece to a phenomenal standard, and I hate to say this, but I actually prefer the piece orchestrated. It was originally written for organ, you see. The best thing about Stokowski is that you see him conducting without a baton, which is exceedingly clever.\n\n2. Tchaikovsky&apos;s Nutcracker- I recommend you see the ballet, because it is a knockout. This is coming from a classical music lover. The animation was superb in this vignette. The most impressive thing though was the fact that the finishes immediately went into the next scene, without it being hackneyed. The waltz, or Dance of the Snow Fairies, was the highlight of this vignette, reminding me so strongly of Christmas.\n\n3. Dukas&apos;s Scorceror&apos;s Apprentice- The most famous vignette, is the only vignette to feature in the sequel. YenSid(Disney backwards) has a magic hat, which he leaves lying around, and Mickey Mouse picks it up, and encounters various problems. the animation is very good here, and while I&apos;m not a huge fan of the piece, I still found it enjoyable.\n\n4. Stravinsky&apos;s Rite of Spring- This is the only reason why the movie isn&apos;t a 10. This vignette is far too long It&apos;s longer than the Beethoven. It is an interesting subject, dinosaurs, but the ballet wasn&apos;t simplified enough. This was boring, and was better left out. It was only here to give some historical context. However, there was beautiful animation and some lovely instrumental solos. Stravinsky hated what the film did to his work, but anyway I don&apos;t like Stravinsky much. I had no problem with the animation or the way it was performed, it was just too long. \n\n5. Beethoven&apos;s pastoral Symphony- This is a fantastic piece of music. I am a huge fan of Beethoven, and I have all his 9 symphonies on my IPod. My favourites are this, the Choral and the Eroica. I loved the fact that they chose a Greek mythological setting, because it looked gorgeous. My dad who is a conductor wasn&apos;t keen on the centaurs, but I loved the winged horses, Bacchus and Zeus (who competes with Chernabog as the most frightening character of the movie). This vignette was so relaxing to watch; think it as like reciting a poem.\n\n6. Ponchielli&apos;s Dance of the Hours-This was the funniest vignette of the film, and one of the many gems of Disney. It was a bit unrealistic of course, but it was fun. At first, I was worried that the most famous scene from the opera La Giaconda, would be ruined by the animation. But it wasn&apos;t. It was perfect. Even the elephants and hippos, considering their size, danced so elegantly, I was shocked. This vignette is a must-see if you want some comedy.\n\n7. Mussorgsky&apos;s Night on Bare Mountain- Now this was my personal favourite, as when I first watched it when I was 10, and I was terrified of Chernabog. The music is also very hard to play, as the mood is very hard to capture, but this is undoubtedly the finest recording of this music. Chernabog was genuinely frightening, and a masterful creation. And the animation, while dark, matched the music, which is enough to give you nightmares, flawlessly. It was very like a Witch&apos;s Sabbath, which was what the composer originally intended. Do you know, that for his underrated fantasy movie Legend, Ridley Scott based Tim Curry&apos;s Darkness on Chernabog? Children may find it a bit too frightening, and adults may find it inappropriate, as there is a tiny glimpse of nudity. But it was still an effective vignette, and one of my favourite Disney moments actually. \n\n8. Schubert&apos;s Ave Maria- This is a beautiful song, and Stokowski did it justice. The harmonies and animation were perfectly captured. how could you say this was boring? The animation couldn&apos;t have been happy looking, it would have completely ruined the mood of the song. It was beautifully sung by Juillietta Novis, who was so quiet that you had to turn the volume up, but that was the intention. The thing that impressed me most, was the complete contrast of this from the Mussorgsky, so the key of Ave Maria was so well chosen. (It is sung in many different keys.) In conclusion, the most underrated of the earlier Disney efforts, is well worth watching and a true animated classic! Also I was offended by the review that said that it was the worst movie ever made, and that the people who love this movie need new taste, that is plain insulting to anyone who grew up with this film. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",

   "reviewBody": "I really want to draw attention to the title of the review above. I&apos;m sure many die-hard potterheads would want every review on this site to score this movie 10/10 and say it is a masterpiece. Well I can&apos;t do that, since that isn&apos;t my honest opinion. What I can say though is that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a thoroughly entertaining affair that is well worth a watch, especially if you&apos;re a fan of J.K. Rowling&apos;s magical world. \n\nFor starters the cast was great. Eddie Redmayne feels perfectly cast in main role as Newt Scamander. A very awkward and introverted person who prefers the company of animals rather than humans. He has the quirkyness down to a tee. I also really liked the muggle (or no-maj as the Americans call him) played by Dan Fogler. How he reacts to the whole wizarding world and the events that happen around him is actually really funny. I also thought Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sodul did great playing two sisters who wind up roped in to the whole adventure. \n\nThe creatures are the best part of the entire movie by far. They CGI on them looks kind of fake, but it&apos;s more than made up for by the concepts alone. Almost all of them have some clever twerk that keep them from feeling generic and they&apos;re all filled with personality. The sequences when they&apos;re catching these creatures are all really fun to watch. \n\nHowever there are some problems with this movie. For one it has way too many side characters. A lot of them feel completely underdeveloped and add basically nothing to the overall story (*cough* Jon Voight *cough*). There&apos;s also a magical threat that becomes more central towards the end but it honestly kind of left me scratching my head. I just wasn&apos;t that engaged in that part of the story to be honest. \n\nStill these problems are not enough to ruin the movie by any means. It&apos;s filled with wonder and creativity and being back in the world of witchcraft and wizardry is worth the price of admission alone. I enjoyed the characters, the humour and the creatures a whole lot. I also want to give J.K. Rowling huge credit for not just rehashing the Harry Potter story again. This is fresh and new and while it isn&apos;t flawless by any means it&apos;s certainly entertaining!",

Yep,in terms of 2004&apos;s most major cinematic disaster,Catwoman was,well,not to put too fine a pun on it,the cat that got the cream.Opening to abominable reviews,from everyone from Empire to Zoo magazine,it was ushered out of cinemas during the &apos;summer blockbuster&apos; period almost as quickly as it was released.It then placed it&apos;s lead star in the embarrassing position of accepting a razzie award having earned an Oscar for her devastating turn in Monster&apos;s Ball only a few years earlier.\n\nIt is a pretty dreadful film,but there are arguably a lot worse.It&apos;s main problem is the story,which is so uninteresting,but the same could be said of the action on display.Also,this is a film that&apos;s managed a pretty notorious achievement.It makes Halle Berry look unsexy.The first suit we see her strutting around in is okay and fairly pleasing to the eye,but the main one (the one she&apos;s in on the poster) is really unsexy and unflattering.\n\nIf you want to engage your curiosity value,go right ahead,but I hope you know what you&apos;re letting yourself in for.**",

   "reviewBody": "**This review is done by a guy who watches/plays a lot of action/violent movies, games and anime... and yet the dumbstruck reviewer finds the prominent theme of Parasyte to be way better than just mindless fighting.**\n\nParasyte is something of a one time enchantment. Just one season and thats just it. Its something you get when elements like action + sci-fi + gore + romance + psychology are added and created by the godlike Japanese. Let me say that after 5-6 years of me turning into an adult, this is the pretty much the one that brought me close to uhh... crying, something that I never do. It made me all giddy up inside with the story driven around a high school guy with an intelligent alien as his right hand, how his perceptions about being a human and how he views humanity changes, how he becomes inhuman (mentally, NOT physically) to the point where its visible to near and dear ones. Love life aside, the protagonist often ponders about how he got this way much like we think at night about ourselves. But its the essence of the protagonist&apos;s mental/psychological change that takes the cake. He concurs that regardless whatever humans go through, certain human elements (read: compassion, envy, self-preservation,but also sacrificing oneself for the greater good etc.) can never be given up, for they are in our blood, in our DNA (though I might be overstating a bit!).\n\nAlso, the pain and suffering of losing a friend (who has a crush on you and you know it) is beautifully depicted and enhanced by the heavenly music. Oh, the music in this anime plays with your heartstrings, I kid you not. And this comes from a guy who isn&apos;t affected by romance genre. Im not going ahead and praising the action and the boss-battles (well implemented), you will have to treat yourself to it but the music really is divine, combining piano with dub-step, it gets your heart pumping. I personally award 11/10 for the BGM. Trust me when I say, the music is on par with Shingeki No Kyojin (Attack On Titan). A segment of Episode 02 will tell you that, you will know what Im talking about once you hear it. I actually watched that segment repeatedly ~20 times, just to hear the BGM.\n\nIt was this combination of awesome elements mixed together beautifully that had driven me to binge watch the entire dubbed series. My only *minor* sorrow (not disappointment) is that I probably will not get to watch a sequel of this legendary franchise, for the manga this show is based upon, ended 20 years ago.\n\nI have already (personally) recommended this to all my friends and will do so here, because you will do yourself a big favor by witnessing this anime. Like I mentioned, for an action- maniac, I barely got into describing the tense action sequences. Treat yourself and go for it, its on par with Tokyo Ghoul (Season 1) and a great experience.\n\nLong Live Japan, Long Live Anime!!!",

   "reviewBody": "The Polar Express delivered me all the way back to childhood and my own faith in Santa Claus at the age of five. I could not only hear the bells, I could see his sleigh in the night sky. Chris Van Allsburg is to be commended for writing an excellent fantasy and Tom Hanks for conducting the wonder tour to beat them all. The special effects are just outstanding, the story line credible and heartwarming. The characters are believable and utterly charming. The children depicted are our own. I would recommend this film to any and all who love Christmas and remember what it is to believe. The experience of watching makes you a participant, breathless to see what comes next. I can hardly wait to view it on IMAX and am taking my entire family, including seven grandchildren to the Tulsa Cinemark this season. Let&apos;s hope we see more of this quality venue in months and years to come.",

So the mere fact that this film feels fresh and leaves me wanting more is more than a poke, yes there is more than a poke, in the right direction. Great performances by all, apparently a lot of it is improvised but the script is well versed in vampire lore and flatting mannerism, nicely produced and well paced. New Zealand seems to have a talent for comedy horror. Peter Jackson&apos;s Brain Dead is perhaps the pinnacle and this from Taika Waititi and Jermane Clement is close on it heels. Gags and gore in equal abundance with a beating heart at its center, entrails to the left. Check it out!",

   "reviewBody": "I first purchased the version made for England, locally as a second hand DVD. It was a speculative purchase, it seemed like it might be okay.\n\nI liked it, but mostly when I re-watched it I started from when Arthur was preparing to go into the Minimoys&apos; land and ended at the start of the journey to Necropolis.\n\nI noticed that many UK reviews either were not impressed or considered that the French soundtrack was way superior. Those views did not make much sense to me.\n\nI then purchased the Blu-ray of Arthur And The Great Adventure and found it to be fairly empty. A wasted purchase. But I remembered the comment about the French language. It was a long shot, but I checked out the Arthur series in Amazon France and purchased the triple DVD box set from there. My plan was to listen in French but watch with the English subtitles on, just the subtitles are only in French so I put my disk set to one side.\n\nDecember, the horror season. For Christmas I decided to check through my disks for Barbie stuff that I had not watched much yet and I also added the Arthur set to the collection, together with seasons 3 and 4 of Trachenberg&apos;s Gossip Girl. Apart from bits of GG, Christmas turned into something other than horror. I do like Barbie movies.\n\nNone of the Arthur disks from France were anything like the stuff that I purchased in England. Feature 1, Arthur Et Les Minimoys is longer and includes a different dialogue to the version for England. It gels as a story. I tend to watch it all the way through, not just the middle bit.\n\nMy Blu-ray of Arthur And The Great Adventure turned out to be a weak edited version of the two remaining stories, Arthur Et La Vengeance De Maltazard (2009) and Arthur Et La Guerre Des Deux Mondes (2010). If I do not re-watch episode 1 so much is because I tend to head to these as well. I also look to the final 15 minutes of Arthur Et La Vengeance De Maltazard as that has a lead in to a magnificent end credits song.\n\nOne big difference between the French and the English is the romance between the 10 year old Arthur and the thousand year old Selenia. In English one accepts that there is a romance because it says so, the French version shows it. It is a real romance type adventure story, in the first feature especially.\n\nFrom other reviews, I get the impression that the version made for France is the cinema release version that was shown in England.",

According to US Robotics, there will be eventually 1 robot to every 5 humans.\n\nSpooner is called to the offices of US Robotics when a leading scientist (James Cromwell), with a secret link to Spooner, has apparently committed suicide. His death seems to have mysterious circumstances which could link to a robot. With man&apos;s complete trust in the new robot technology, it seems too ludicrous to every one except Spooner.\n\nAs the mystery deepens, Spooner unravels the very fabric of the robotic giant, locks horns with CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) and learns more about his automated enemy with the aid of scientist Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan). Through the course of these events he may learn more than he could ever imagine.\n\nIt is hard to defend a film like &apos;I, Robot&apos; but I am going to try. For sci-fi purists, Isaac Asimov&apos;s legendary work about the robot and how he will intricate into our society has filled the minds of readers for over 50 years. But the similarities between the film presented here and his work are few and far between. Kind of like last week&apos;s release of Jerry Bruckheimer&apos;s &apos;King Arthur&apos;. Both films take sacred subject matter and re-invent it with a new twist. I would have to say that &apos;I. Robot&apos; is better in a lot ways.\n\nAt the core of &apos;I, Robot&apos; beats the soul of Asimov as his 3 laws regarding robots are sacredly left intact and the film does abide by them. Also a lot of the characters have similar names to the people in the text. It is almost like taking Star Trek&apos;s &apos;prime directive&apos; and some of the now classic characters and setting them in a new idea of the future. The core is left intact but in some ways it has been updated and refreshed.\n\nThe story, special effects and extremely zealous direction, however, all seem to be brought forth by the collaborators who cobbled this film together. There are influences of &apos;Robocop&apos;, &apos;Short Circuit&apos;, &apos;Blade Runner&apos; and even the classic comic-book series &apos;Magnus: Robot Fighter&apos;. Each of these robot influences echo back to what makes &apos;I Robot&apos; so intriguing, a joy to watch and memorable. \n\nSure the story does have a lot of sci-fi influences and clich\u00e9s aside from robot films including &apos;Star Wars&apos; and &apos;Planet of the Apes&apos; but don&apos;t these benchmark sci-fi films influence everything coming down the turnpike these days. It even has the classic sci-fi clich\u00e9 of the social outcast claiming there is an invasion coming except no one believes him. But that is not what should bring us into the film.\n\nYou really need to give credit to director Alex Proyas because it is his magic as a filmmaker that holds this film together. He knows where to play it straight and where to let his lead actor bring on the charm. Also you really have to admire the man&apos;s technical ability. His brilliant inter-laying of robots into the photography is astounding. Proyas is an A-list director in the making and &apos;I, Robot&apos; shows that he can deliver a big Hollywood film.\n\nI also give credit to Will Smith who starts out being very unapproachable with his character but as the film goes we really become fond of his hero. Smith&apos;s Spooner does have a lot of his previous sci-fi heroes inter-laced into Spooner but it comes off as more of a homecoming than an annoyance. In some ways I think Proyas had something to do with that especially in the chase down scene towards the beginning of the film. It almost felt like &apos;Men in Black&apos; again.\n\nAs for Smith&apos;s co-stars, Cromwell&apos;s Lanning is a throwaway character used mainly for effect, Moynahan is timid and sometimes robot-like but it is a sturdy performance and Greenwood is menacing and a good match to face off against the rebellious Smith. \n\nThe reason I was so fond of &apos;I, Robot&apos; is because for once it was a summer film that didn&apos;t apologize for trying to be entertaining. The special effects, the performances and the direction are all what people want to see in the summer and this film is loads and loads of fun. It is a great giant popcorn film with a light layering of message. \n\nMy only small problem with this film was that it is supposed to be set in Chicago in 2035. I didn&apos;t buy it but if it was 2135, then maybe.\n\nSure the film doesn&apos;t pave new ground but why does every film have to. It is pure summer fun and what is wrong with that.\n\nIf you want Asimov and sci-fi purism then you can always read the novels. Stop apologizing and most of all stop belly-aching, just give the film a chance. If you like science fiction films and want to be remembered how much fun they used to be then this picture is the perfect ticket for you. So Says the Soothsayer.",

   "reviewBody": "So I&apos;ve finally seen this much talked about film and I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The H8 is a 168 min long movie which is described as a sort of mystery thriller and a lot a noise was made (mainly by Quentin himself) when the script leaked early and therefore would harm the box office chances of this flick. The movie did indeed not make big waves money wise but that was mainly because the overly long movie does actually not amount to much story wise. In other words there is no real clue. The dialogue, normally the strongpoint of Tarantino films, is actually not that great. Conversations are drawn out without the characters actually saying anything. It does help a lot that we do get a great cast (Kurt Russel, Sam L Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh) because without them the movie would fall apart rather quickly. The film was shot on 2,76:1 70mm widescreen because retro elitist Tarantino thinks digital isn&apos;t good enough and I do have to say the snowy landscape shots look awesome but they make up only 2% of the flick. The rest of it is in a cabin where standard 35mm or even a digital camera could have perfectly captured the images. About the music I can be short: there is almost none. It&apos; might have been composed by Moricone who unrightfully got an Oscar for it, but it does not add much here in this film. I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t see it on the big screen. It works just as well on the small screen, maybe even better coz you can pauze it to get more booze and a snack. So despite my rather harsh comments I would recommend it but know that this is far from Tarantino&apos;s best work.",

   "heading": "Easily the weirdest film you&apos;ll see all year",
   "reviewBody": "There&apos;s no chance that you&apos;ll see a film as weird as The Lobster this whole year. In what is effectively an indie art-house piece, you get a completely insane and almost unfathomable world filled with more and more absurdities everywhere you look. However, it&apos;s such an incredibly unique and eye-catching film that it&apos;s still hugely engrossing and surprisingly entertaining to watch.\n\nThe story centres around one man, played by Colin Farrell, as he attempts to find a partner as a part of this bizarre system. The first act revolves around his time in &apos;The Hotel&apos;, and is not only hugely odd, but both dramatic and unnerving as well as hilarious to watch, featuring some of the best dark comedy written in years.\n\nThe film takes its story as seriously as any drama, and you feel that through the deeply disturbing atmosphere that emerges off the screen. However, as the film is just so weird, it eases you into the oddness of it all very impressively through the use of humour, something that more pretentious art-house films fail to do, and are resultantly a lot harder to really get into.\n\nSo, you&apos;ll definitely be laughing a lot, if not in a more disturbed than hugely entertained manner, throughout the first act, and by the end of it, you&apos;ll surely be as used as you can be to the incredibly weird feel of this whole film.\n\nJust to give you an idea of how unorthodox this film is, every scene is full of awkward silences, the actors speak as if they&apos;re reading off of cue cards with no emotion whatsoever, the imagery is very ugly and unpleasant to look at right the way through, and the incredible slow pace of it all means that the film feels like it goes on for about five times as long as it actually does.\n\nAnd yet, I still can&apos;t get around the fact that this is a brilliant film. Mainly, it&apos;s the fact that it&apos;s just so unique and almost shockingly bizarre, but it&apos;s just filled with so many captivating ideas that it&apos;s impossible not to be fully drawn into this insane story.\n\nSo, the performances, the directing, the writing, and pretty much everything is stunning, apart from one big issue that prevents this from being a truly incredible film. Following the end of the first act, the film does lose its way quite a lot, taking almost too big a leap into an even stranger abyss than you ever imagined at the beginning, and, with a little less humour in the latter stages, isn&apos;t as easy to watch as the first act had been.\n\nHowever, it does pick up again towards a terrifying and as bizarre as ever conclusion, and that&apos;s why I&apos;m going to give The Lobster a 9 out of 10, but I must warn you that if you feel you can&apos;t cope with this film for longer than the first twenty minutes, then it&apos;s not for you. This is definitely a cult film for the ages, but won&apos;t be a big hit with general audiences.",

Storywise, it is simple enough for kids to enjoy but there are too many plot holes so forget about educating them about animals. The pacing is quite bad as it really slows down in the middle. Some of the gags are overdone and as a result, they fall flat. The dialogues are mostly okay.\n\nThe CGI is far from terrific but the vivid colours somehow make up for it. The virtual Madagascar is colourful and spectacular to look at. There is plenty of energy (sometimes a bit too much) to keep the audience tuned.\n\nThe characters are a tad over the top. Chris Rock, David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith are alright. Ben Stiller tends to be a little irritating. McGrath, Knights and Miller totally rock as the three penguins. For me, the penguins were the best and funniest parts.\n\n&apos;Madagascar&apos; may not be the best example of entertaining CGI flicks but it makes for a decent one time watch as long as the viewer is willing to suspend their beliefs to a certain extent.",

   "reviewBody": "What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving &apos;tricks&apos; like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter&apos;s place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough &apos;fluff&apos; to make it sound like a real conversation instead of &apos;movie dialogue&apos; (the funny asides like &apos;please move your leg&apos; and &apos;your ridiculously hot aunt&apos;), etc.\n\nThe same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony&apos;s holographic &apos;flashback&apos; . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony&apos;s attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony&apos;s later actions.\n\nThese two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour&apos;s worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.\n\nThis film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",

   "reviewBody": "It just goes to show how wrong you can be. I had not expected to like this film. I was disappointed by both the Kill Bill films (although i preferred the second) and Death Proof (although it was better in the shorter cut of the double-bill release). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction and think that Jackie Brown is Tarantino&apos;s most mature piece of film-making - technically his most superior - including the last great performance elicited from Robert De Niro. Since then it seems to me while his films have been okay (i haven&apos;t hated them) he has been treading water in referential, reverential, self-indulgent juvenilia.\n\nThen i read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and i hated it! Sure it had some typical QT flourishes and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were a couple of great characters. But on page it was more juvenile rubbish, largely ruined by the largess of the uninteresting Basterds of the title. It made me seriously contemplate not seeing the film. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I only changed by mind when i had the opportunity to see the film with a Tarantino Q&A following in London. I figured it would be worth enduring to hear him in Q&A as i know from interviews how entertaining he can be in person.\n\nSo little was i prepared for the sheer exuberant fun and brilliance of Inglourious Basterds.\n\nEasily Mr Tarantino&apos;s best work since Jackie Brown it is a triumph.\n\nYes the references are there but they do not interfere with the story, they are not the driving force. Yes Eli Roth is stunt casting but he works fine, with little to do but look aggressive, and does nothing to hurt the film as i had feared. While i admired Mr Tarantino for using stuntwoman Zoe Bell as herself in Death Proof in order to amp-up the exhilaration of the major stunt scene her lack of any acting ability in a key role was a problem for the film. The same could be said of Tarantino&apos;s own appearances in several films, especially Robert Rodriguez&apos;s From Dusk Till Dawn, which Tarantino wrote.\n\nWhat really makes this work is how BIG it is. The spaghetti western vibe to much of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderfully over the top without descending too far into the cartoon quality of Kill Bill. The violence is so big. The audacity so big. Brad Pitt is so big! In the trailers the Hitler moment and Pitt&apos;s performance bothered me but in the context of the film they are hilarious. Pitt is actually brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is Mifune&apos;s blustering samurai in Yojimbo, he is Robards Cheyenne from Once Upon a Time in the West, there is a very James Coburn vibe to him, and of course a suitably Lee Marvin edge.\n\nChristoph Waltz (who i did not previously known) and Melanie Laurent (who i first noticed in a brilliant French-language British short film by Sean Ellis) are sensational and i expect to see both used a lot more in the future. Tarantino has clearly not lost his eye for casting, which seemed to desert him in Death Proof. Waltz is equally large in his performance. Chilling, yet theatrical. He is Fonda from OUATITW, Van Cleef from Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is suitably Cardinale innocence but tough, a fighter. They both dazzle here.\n\nThat every member of the cast gets the fun to be had from what they are doing while not indulging themselves in just having fun and trying to get laughs helps tremendously. The laughs - and there are loads - come organically. Only Mike Myers comes close to tipping the wink and pushing it too far but his scene is reigned in just enough - with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender who seems pulled directly from the mold of Attenborough&apos;s Great Escape leader.\n\nAll the actors shine and Tarantino throws in wonderful flourishes, but ones that work with the story. The introduction of Schweiger&apos;s Hugo Stiglitz is a riot. After a sensational slow-burn opening and a glorious intro to those inglourious Basterds the pace never lets up and over two and half hours flies by.\n\nIt also looks beautiful, marking this as a return to real film-making rather than just self-indulgent silliness. The musical choices, as always, are inspired from Morricone on.\n\nThe film is audacious and hilarious. After a summer when nearly every film has disappointed me it came as a huge surprise that the real fun and entertaining, but also involving and impressive film should be this one, when i would never have believed it from script form. Welcome back QT.",

Don&apos;t get me wrong, the movie was well made, there were some terrific scenes that you can tell that the designers put their heart and soul into, but the plot was a little out of whack. A kid watching this movie, would probably fall asleep; it started off really cute and funny-ish but then the writers went off on a completely irrelevant curb that made the movie super long and super pointless for any kid under 10. An adult may have found this movie insightful and thought provoking, but also a little confusing and overwhelming. It&apos;s a good movie but there were too many messages and meanings that were left undone and left me wanting more for a person that just wanted to see a cute animated cartoon about some dancing penguins.",

   "reviewBody": "Although The Martian is set in an indeterminate future I have questions about labeling it science fiction. One of the film&apos;s best strengths is that it is based on what we know about the landscape and atmosphere of Mars right at this point in time. It&apos;s a desert planet with water and no life as we know it. Compared to what Matt Damon has to go through, Robinson Crusoe was on that tropical isle for a picnic.\n\nThey never really say just exactly what year The Martian is set in. The film in that sense avoids a trap like so many others fall into. Just this past year we saw 2015 come and go and it wasn&apos;t really anything like the 2015 that Marty McFly experienced. That&apos;s just one example.\n\nOf course you can also never predict what popular trends will be there. That&apos;s purely speculative. So you can&apos;t have Matt Damon&apos;s character listening to current music. His captain&apos;s taste in music was 70s disco and that really became a running joke. It&apos;s all he heard for the months he was on Mars. Personally I&apos;d prefer a selection of 30s and 40s music with Bing Crosby at the top of my list. But if that&apos;s all I heard for months on end, I&apos;d grow to hate Der Bingle. \n\nAnd that&apos;s part of the story, the everlasting boredom trying to keep your mind fresh and busy with tasks for your survival. Like Mr. Roberts from tedium to apathy and always boredom.\n\nWhat happens in The Martian is that Damon is part of an astronaut team and gets left behind when a Martian sand storm erupts and the crew flees on the space ship. Captain Jessica Chastain takes when she thinks Damon was killed. \n\nThe future also brings us better communication and NASA learns that Matt&apos;s still there. To say that there&apos;s a public relations problem is putting it mildly. Just leaving him there is actually an option discussed. But that goes against the code of a decent civilization which while we&apos;re not at Star Trek level yet, we look to be heading that way.\n\nAlthough The Martian splits time evenly with Damon&apos;s plight and the efforts to rescue him, Matt&apos;s time alone on the screen with the full range of emotions displayed is what got him his Best Actor nomination. Besides the realistic depiction of Mars, his performance is the other pillar on which this fine film rests. I would give mention to Jessica Chastain and her fine performance as a tough and yet humane leader of her team.\n\nBesides Matt Damon, The Martian is also up for Best Picture and for a flock of awards in the technical categories. It should take home deserved statues this year.",

   "reviewBody": "In my attempt to rewatch all the MCU-movies chronologically I began with the first Iron Man. To cut to the chase: it&apos;s still good. A couple of things astonished me, though:\n\nFirst of all, a common mistake of the later Marvel-movies isn&apos;t made here. There is actually some sort of character development visible. Tony ends the movie as a totally different person. Of course, in an origin story it&apos;s easier to have your protagonist change but let&apos;s compare for a second: Is Ant-man really a changed man at the end of the movie? What about Star Lord? What about Thor? Black Widow? Hawkeye?\n\nThen again, you have to give it to the director that he really made a well-paced, well-balanced movie. There is action, humour, drama, world establishing, all in great balance. The final fight isn&apos;t stretched too long and therefore doesn&apos;t get boring. You can&apos;t underestimate this in our age of 45 mins battles at the end of movies.\n\nDuring my re-watch I also noticed how &apos;down to earth&apos; this movie is if you compare it to some of the more recent MCU-entries. It just looks more real than them. It&apos;s set in a world that at least COULD be real which makes us care more for the characters and their actions. More explosions and obvious cgi-effects don&apos;t improve a movie. So the movie doesn&apos;t feel as bloated as some other superhero flicks.\n\nFinally, Iron Man is still fun to watch and not just a vehicle to set up a franchise. If you&apos;ve spent the last couple of years on the moon and haven&apos;t seen any of the MCU-movies, give this a try.",

   "reviewBody": "Astro Boy has always been the symbol of the golden era of anime as well as the golden era of American licensing of anime. This movie presents Astro Boy in a slightly new way.\n\nThe story for it is rather simple, but doesn&apos;t fail in keeping one entertain throughout it&apos;s time run. Those who seen the three anime adaptations would already know the origin of Astro Boy&apos;s creation. That&apos;s still included as well as appearances of a couple of recognizable characters. And a couple of new additions that fit in for this movie.\n\nNow to list the good and bad thing about this movie. The good thing is this movie remains true to the concept and Astro Boy a like. It still takes place in the future where robots and humans live together. As well as robot civil rights which was a common topic in the previous Astro Boy adaptations on robots being questioned whether they should have the same rights as humans or not.\n\nBad thing is that the movie could of been a whole lot more if the writers made the movie feel more close to the anime with the addition of more characters or have Dr. Elefun & Daddy Walrus have either bigger parts or have at least have the same feel as their anime counterparts. I also think this movie tried too hard in Americanizing it by adding certain human characters that look like they belong in a different movie or the fact that they were trying to make it look more American by having the characters eat pizza instead of tempura.\n\nThe die hard fans of Astro Boy will likely to still enjoy this movie. It&apos;s not a mirror copy of it&apos;s anime counterpart but doesn&apos;t fail in being entertaining. To me it&apos;s something that will make popcorn taste better while watching it.",

Nolan takes the zebra home, and his teenage daughter Channing (Hayden Panettiere) wants to keep him as a pet. She names the baby zebra Stripes. The farm is located near the racetrack and the zebra grows up believing that he is a racehorse. Stripes has a dream of racing the other horses at the track, and to get into shape, Stripes races the mailman in his truck. All the farm animals help Stripes and Channing achieve their racing dream. This is a cute movie made in the same framework as the movie &apos;Babe&apos;, where all the animals speak to each other. The horseflies Scuzz and Buzz (voices of David Spade and Steve Harvey) had some of the funniest scenes. This is a light hearted film that your children will like. Don&apos;t take the script too seriously or you will miss the fun. (Warner Brothers Pictures, Run time 1:34, Rated PG) (4/10)",

All these aspects lead to a raw portrayal of love that many experience in life, with still providing a sense of hope and wonder to the viewers.

   "reviewBody": "Ladies, this one is for you. Some of you may have suspected it all along, but this film confirms God is a chauvinist pig (well, the clues were all there, come to think of it). Luckily - but unbeknownst to most - God also has a daughter, and she&apos;s had enough of her mean-spirited, bad-tempered Father and is about to teach Him a lesson. \n\nWith the help of her brother (yes, THAT brother) and a somewhat unorthodox band of newly appointed disciples, she&apos;s determined to make her own mark on the universe. Needless to say, God&apos;s having none of it and tries to do everything in His - considerable - power to stop His rebellious daughter from undoing everything He&apos;s worked so hard for. \n\nThis hilarious satire is a firework of inspired ideas and just a blast from start to finish. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves intelligent, absurdist comedy in the vein of &apos;Life of Brian&apos; or &apos;South Park&apos; and doesn&apos;t get easily offended. 8 stars out of 10.\n\nIn case you&apos;re interested in more underrated masterpieces, here&apos;s a list with some of my favorites:\n\nimdb.com/list/ls070242495",

   "reviewBody": "When I first heard that this film was going to be split into two movies instead of being presented as one as originally planned, I was angry. I accused the powers that be of trying to squeeze two box office triumphs out of a single project. But after having seen both &apos;Kill Bill&apos; and &apos;Kill Bill Vol.2&apos;, I am glad because both films are extremely different even though the stories are tied together with primarily the same actors and having the same director. Containing less action than &apos;Kill Bill&apos;, volume 2 is intelligent, bizarre and extremely engrossing. It absorbs all of its elements equally and David Carradine&apos;s performance as Bill is the best thing to happen in movie villain history since, well, I&apos;ll leave that up to individual interpretation.",

Overall this film is a film for everyone,it has music that makes you want to get up and dance right there in the theater.I give Baby Driver a 10/10,go and see it now.",

   "reviewBody": "Bolt follows a canine actor known for playing a super hero on a TV show, he is supported from his owner and must find his way back to her, all while believing he truly has super powers.\n\nBolt is loads of fun! There are lots of creative action scenes, plenty of funny jokes, and even some emotional scenes. Bolt has the makings of a Disney classic, but it does come up a little short of the usual Disney magic.\n\nFirstly, the story lacks depth, the story basically tells itself in the first 30 minutes, then fuels the rest with action, comedy and drama. Secondly Miley Cyrus proved to be an annoying choice for voicing one of the main characters, not only is she an ear-sore, but she struggles to express different emotions vocally, her voice feels fake and just detracts from the overall film.\n\nLuckily there&apos;s still plenty good in Bolt, it&apos;s definitely a great choice for a family friendly action comedy!",

The thing to hold onto is that despite all the negative hype in the worldwide press, this is one heck of a great movie. I have no idea why any film studio would want to distance themselves from this film, it is fresh in a time when fresh is a very rare thing in the movies. Avatar managed it in heaps and so does John Carter. The story is grand and intriguing, the characters are solid and believable, and the CGI is so good you forget about it. This will become one of my favourite all time movies, it is up there amongst the very best of the genre. \n\nDon&apos;t believe the hype.. this is a must see movie!!",

Instead of developing the background of the Pharaoh or giving character development to Kabia the movie is mostly just a duel between Kabia and Yugi (as Little Kurbioh cleverly claimed that&apos;s never been done before) while Kabia is actually being used by Anubis (who somehow knows about the Pharaoh) his plan doesn&apos;t make a lot of sense. The thing that I&apos;m most disappointed about this movie was just how long the duel between Yugi and Kabia was. I know that they wanted to promote cards for the game but it felt really obvious that they were doing that. Save your money and your time and don&apos;t watch this movie (Bonds Beyond Time is way better)",

   "reviewBody": "The Shallows (2016) \n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nNancy (Blake Lively) heads to a secluded beach in Mexico that her mother had visited years earlier. The plan is to surf and reflect on her life but soon she&apos;s fighting for it when she&apos;s attacked by a Great White shark.\n\nTHE SHALLOWS has been called the best shark movie since JAWS and it&apos;s easy to see why so many people are falling in love with it. Director Jaume Collet-Serra has certainly created one of the more memorable thrillers of the past few years and while there&apos;s a lot of scenes with the shark the director also manages to build up suspense without seeing it. This is certainly a movie where the director has full control of the experience and he really delivers a nice little gem.\n\nThe greatest thing about the movie is certainly it&apos;s suspense factor. Going into the movie you already know that there&apos;s a shark that is going to attack so this immediately gets you ready for what&apos;s to come. What works so well is the fact that everything goes as you&apos;d expect but at the thirty minute mark things take a bigger turn and we get several more twists and surprises. I&apos;m obviously not going to ruin them here but there&apos;s no doubt that there are several scenes that will have your stomach in a knot as you wait to see where the next attack is going to come from.\n\nThe director delivers all sorts of great excitement and there&apos;s no doubt that the shark attacks are wonderfully done. What&apos;s so great about them is that the shark looks 100% real and there&apos;s never any feeling that you&apos;re watching a CGI shark like DEEP BLUE SEA or some other crap movie you&apos;d see on SyFy. The movie also works whenever the shark isn&apos;t attacking because the director builds up such a relationship between the viewer and the Nancy character that you can&apos;t help but feel suspense even when the shark isn&apos;t there.\n\nLively turns in a very good performance as she perfectly hits on several emotional marks. Oscar Jaenada also deserves a lot of credit for the few scenes that he is in. There are a few flaws here and there, including a horrible ending but there&apos;s no question that THE SHALLOWS delivers the goods.",

Then a strange storm appears with numerous intense lightning. Suddenly machines rise out of the ground to destroy mankind.\n\nDirector Steven Spielberg uses all his tech skills to create great CGI of this H.G. Wells vision. It looks great. There are great individual scenes like the train. Tom Cruise is good as a father looking out for his family. But a couple of things keep coming back to nag at me. The kids are a bit too much to take. I&apos;m willing to take Dakota Fanning screaming at everything, but I can&apos;t take the annoying rebellious teen. The constant fighting with the father is so petty and so childish. The family melodrama just diminishes the scale of the movie. Then there is the change of the origins of the alien machines. It is simply a stupid idea from Spielberg to be different. There is no reason for it. Worst it makes the movie questionable. And the blood idea just adds to the silliness of the story. These are changes for the sake of changing without improving anything.",

   "dateCreated": "2006-11-07",

   "heading": "Enjoyable thriller but there are failings and missed targets across the running time",
   "reviewBody": "The war between the police and the organised crime in Boston has reached new heights. Both Oliver Queenan and target #1 Frank Costello have placed a mole into each other&apos;s organisations. Billy Costigan is selected to infiltrate Costello&apos;s ranks thanks to a family background of criminals and working men, meanwhile Colin Sullivan has been groomed since youth to come up inside the ranks of the BPD. As Costigan makes progress it becomes clear to his police superiors that they too have a rat feeding information outwards. With only Frank knowing Sullivan&apos;s identity and Queenan and Dignam knowing Costigan&apos;s, a race begins with the first one to expose the other winning.\n\nHaving enjoyed the original film, I was quite looking forward to this film and not really worried that Hollywood would mess it up. In a way it does deliver but it is hard to ignore the problems and failings in the film and if I didn&apos;t realise how IMDb put together their top 250 list, I would be amazed that the film is running so high up it. The original was a tight cop thriller which I remember thinking owed much to American cinema in style and tone, so surely America can only do it better? Well, if not better then this is certainly bigger, with stars oozing out of every pore, a big director and a long running time. In regards the latter, the film should be commended for moving slickly through the 150 minutes and not feeling as long as it is. The fact that it is cool, engaging and quite exciting will be enough for most audiences and indeed the sheer volume of positive votes on this site shows it has struck something of a chord, but this is not to say it is a classic and those putting it alongside Goodfellas are simply out of their trees.\n\nThe script here tries to give more room for growth to the characters, to explore their feelings outside of the tension and fear of their situation. Unfortunately this produces many scenes that are a bit dull and unconvincing as they attempt to deepen the material. Specifically I am talking about the thread involving the girlfriend, her scenes add little and the dialogue in the session scenes is obvious and, as a Sopranos viewer, I was surprised by this. A secondary downside of this (although not totally to blame) is that it is not as gripping and claustrophobic as I would have liked. Yes it is thrilling at times but I wanted it to be consistent like a real cat&apos;n&apos;mouse game with the noose tightening palatably around each character&apos;s neck as they raced to hang the other first. The ending is also a little less effective than it should be because, added to the original&apos;s strong ending is an extra scene that doesn&apos;t have a strong foundation and is not as good as it should have been.\n\nIronically for such a starry affair, some of the performances are a bit weak, and I&apos;m thinking specifically of Damon. He never seems like the flipped version of Costigan and I never really got the feeling of him being trapped, panicked and hunted in the same way as his opposite number was. Conversely then DiCaprio is pretty strong and is convincing as he loses himself into Costello&apos;s gang of murderers. He works well alongside a scene-stealing Nicholson. At times he threatens to completely tip over into ham but for the most part he is just larger than life and provides a lot of energy to the film. This energy is harnessed well by director Scorsese who directs with this usual eye for a setup and also an enjoyable soundtrack. The use of sudden stops in the music and quick cuts is perhaps a bit much to get used to but it is strangely effective. The support cast is impressive in depth but they are not all that well used. Walhberg has all the best lines but it seems like he has wandered in from another movie at times and, funny as he was, he is never the developed and involved character that he needed to be for the way the narrative required. Baldwin is the same although he is more restrained and fits better, while Sheen is a nice touch of class. The woman playing the girlfriend is as weak as her material and although she did have an important part in the story, she adds very little beyond the writing on the page.\n\nOverall though, this is a strong and professional film and it is a shame that it isn&apos;t as good as I wanted. The attempts to paint detailed and complex characters makes it interesting but not as convincing as it needed to be \u0096 with Damon in particular left out there with little to work with in comparison to DiCaprio. The moments of slick tension and action are very good though and the only downside was that it made me wish for more of the same and that Scorsese had focused on keeping it tight and taut in the same way that the superior original had.",

   "reviewBody": "Its 1873; New Mexico Territory; an \u00a0Outlaw and a Cattle Rancher must put aside their differences to stop Alien invaders hellbent on experimenting on humans and stripping the land of its gold.\n\nThere&apos;s something kooky about the title Cowboys and Aliens, B-movie-ish, yet, exciting, enticing and genius. However, even with the star talents including\u00a0Daniel Craig and\u00a0Harrison Ford, with the striking\u00a0Olivia Wilde and excellent Sam Rockwell Cowboys and Aliens still falls short of expectations. The script is bland, every effort has gone into developing the two main leads but at a cost of the rest of the characters, the basic story and plot. \u00a0\n\nThe special and practical effects are well integrated and executed but while fantastic they are nothing that hasn&apos;t been seen before, reminiscent of District 9, Independence Day to name a few. Considering director&apos;s\u00a0Jon Favreau fun and exciting Iron-man outings this offering is less satisfying. It&apos;s not the mishmash of classic genres that&apos;s the problem, it&apos;s the lazy, predicable story telling.\u00a0\n\nThe films opening is strong and intriguing, building up to the tension of Ford&apos;s character Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde meeting with Craig&apos;s Jake; its Jones meets Bond, perfect. Both are excellent giving weight to the proceedings. Horses are flipped, guns and gauntlets go wild, aliens leap and stomp on cowboys. But after the first few alien attacks the film wavers onto familiar territory. Although it has a fabulous cast beneath its hat and sweeping, breathtaking Western landscapes under it&apos;s belt - it buckles under it&apos;s own weight.\u00a0\n\nEven with its somewhat serious tone it&apos;s not brave enough to explore or\u00a0commit to its own themes leaving it underdeveloped. But it also omits much needed fun leaving the whole film unseasoned and as empty as the plains of Arizona. Debatably, flop Wild Wild West (1999) infused the sci-fi and Western genre more successfully.\u00a0\n\nCowboys and Aliens is entertaining, it looks good, has a superb cast but it&apos;s painfully predictable and just not that great.",

   "reviewBody": "Was very pleasantly surprised by &apos;The LEGO Movie&apos;. Initially wasn&apos;t sure as to whether a film based on a popular (and timeless) children&apos;s toy merchandise would work, but it ended up being one of the best animated films that year and one of the year&apos;s most entertaining.\n\n&apos;The LEGO Batman Movie&apos; was seen with higher expectations, knowing what to expect and being somebody who likes Batman very much, and was every bit as good if not better. Its only stumbling block is the last half hour or so, which tonally (with things taking a more dramatic and darker tone) felt too far removed from the rest of the film and not only did it lose momentum it also felt somewhat overblown. With that being said, &apos;The LEGO Batman Movie&apos; was a sheer delight for Batman and superhero fans, anybody who loved &apos;The LEGO Movie&apos; and wants to see a fresh take on Batman and superheroes will not be disappointed.\n\nLike with &apos;The LEGO Movie&apos;, the animation is really first rate, the vibrant yet dynamic colours are remarkably vivid to the extent that it makes the eyes pop, the backgrounds are immaculately designed, the characters look remarkably good in Lego form and a lot of the visuals especially in the action are very inventive. There is a bright and breezy soundtrack that compliments The Lego Movie beautifully, a lot of it is very catchy with a touch of humour while also giving room for a more understated touch.\n\nAgain, the script bursts with imaginative verbal and visual gags, while there is a sharp wit, snappy dialogue and thick and fast jokes that all hit their mark. A lot of it is hilarious and makes the film one of 2017&apos;s most entertaining, but it&apos;s more than just comedy. There is a lot of poignant heart, block-busting action and some inspirational messaging. What makes &apos;The LEGO Batman Movie&apos; especially good is how it feels like a celebration of Batman while mocking previous incarnations and his origins with glee.\n\nStory is fast-paced and energetic, with lots of humour and heart. There are a lot of characters here but not too many, the characters (heroes and villains) have their entertaining quirks and personalities yet the film really allows you to properly care for them as well. The voice work is exemplary, with note perfect turns from Will Arnett and Ralph Fiennes and actors who on paper sounded completely wrong for their roles actually nailing them (Zach Galifianakis could easily have been a disaster as Joker but was both entertaining and menacing, Michael Cera is also the most likable he has been in a long time).\n\nIn summary, wonderful, perfect for kids and adults alike and a delight for Batman/superhero fans. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

I would have to say that this film is not my favourite so far and leaves you feeling that some vital parts of the book are missing. However this is worth watching and I feel this will only disappoint the most hardcore Harry fans! \n\nWith all of the films you can notice that the acting is improving with the maturity of the characters. You can tell that there is a close bond between the actors of which all pull of their roles well. The directing and visual effects, like all of the films to date does not disappoint. \n\nIn all a great family film, a pleasure to watch and I would recommend this film to most people. I am glad that the final film will be split into two parts, to be honest they could have done it with this film! \n\n*** For people who have never seen any of the films or read the books I took my friend with me who has not seen or read any of the books and he was completely lost throughout the film (Although he still enjoyed it!). If you wish to see this I would recommend you need to see Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix first. Otherwise you may find this film a little confusing.",

   "inLanguage": "English",
   "heading": "Hugely funny, technically brilliant",
   "reviewBody": "I saw Flushed Away at a press screening in Berlin where it was shown in English to an overwhelmingly German audience. Leaving aside the clich\u00e9s (Germans DO have a sense of humour - it&apos;s just different, okay?!), coming as yet another in a long line of CGI films and with (let&apos;s be honest here) a less than gripping concept, Flushed Away had only a certain amount of goodwill from this professional crowd. So when an audience like this, yours truly included, laughs aloud and often then there&apos;s something special up on the screen!\n\nThe humour is overwhelmingly English and there is none of the morality messaging that makes family films from certain other studios such a cringe-inducing experience. The characters are very well drawn (literally as well as figuratively) and the voice casting is universally excellent. The standard of animation is fantastic but you never once get the sense that anyone is showing off what they can do. This is a story- and character-driven film, with the technology there to serve. Anyone writing it off because it is not claymation is doing themselves a great disservice.\n\nLovers of Wallace & Gromit and Aardman&apos;s work in general will have a ball spotting the oh so many references. The level of detail is amazing and it&apos;s going to take many viewings and many hours with the DVD on pause to spot them all. There are the bunnies from Curse of the Wererabbit, for example. I spotted the Lion King on the little girl&apos;s windowsill, and so on. And on.\n\nWhen a film credits several writers, plus comedy consultants, it&apos;s usually a sign that the script has gone horribly and tragically wrong. Maybe it did, to begin with, and the start is just a tad slow, but it soon picks up speed and the jokes, verbal and visual, just keep coming.\n\nLike the best family films, Flushed Away appeals to audiences of all ages, but the very young might find it a bit long. Not that it lags at any time, merely that the wee tots might get fidgety, you understand.\n\nThe cast do a great job and I&apos;m not going to single out anyone for special mention. The performances are spot on and everyone is obviously having a tongue in cheek good time. For professional reasons, I get to watch some 300 or more films a year. Flushed Away belongs to the very, very few that I wanted to see again right after it had finished. And before you ask, no, I am not being paid, induced or threatened at gunpoint to write this. I had a cracking good time, as did my girlfriend (Julia, German, with sense of humour) and you will too.",

   "reviewBody": "I first heard about this film on youtube. It would often pop up in reviews and top lists. I recommend you not to believe the hype and watch the movie with an open mind. Otherwise you risk being disappointed like I was. \n\nThe source material for this movie is amazing. Folktales are a horror goldmine and it&apos;s a shame you don&apos;t see it being used so often. The movie draws you in with it&apos;s original concept and stetting. \n\nThe approach to horror itself is very unorthodox in the sense that most horror movies nowadays rely on obscurity or grotesque visuals. This movie shows horror in broad daylight, the camera is steady, there are no monsters, no gore. So what good is it? - Realism. Especially in the supernatural scenes. The rawness of theses scenes is the best part. You&apos;re always asking yourself &apos;is this superstition or is this real?&apos; and &apos;who is the real villain?&apos;. Of course that&apos;s until the charm is ruined by the bullshit ending where those questions are answered in the worst way possible. If they left room for speculation and stuck to the subtle approach I would&apos;ve given this film a 6 or a 7. \n\n&apos;The Witch&apos; had some good ideas but it&apos;s far from perfect. I feel sorry for people who claim that this movie is some &apos;masterpiece&apos;. Apparently they&apos;ve been watching only shitty movies this whole time. The cinematography was dry and even felt effortless. I liked the composition in only one shot: the dinner prayer. The picture lacks tonal contrast to compensate the lack of color. It just fails at grasping your attention. Only parts where the dryness benefits the movie are the horror scenes, all the other shots are just tedious and repetitive. Sorry, but it needs to have style or at least some visual value before it can qualify as a &apos;masterpiece&apos;. \n\nThe actors did a great job. My favorite was Kate Dickie as Katherine who I think came off as more threatening then the actual witch. \n\nYou can tell that &apos;The Witch&apos; was heavily inspired by Stanley Kubrick&apos;s work (sadly Eggers doesn&apos;t take notes from his shot composition though). Not only has it similar motives to &apos;The Shining&apos; but also a soundtrack that resembles Ligeti&apos;s &apos;Requiem&apos; form &apos;2001 Space Odyssey&apos;.",

   "reviewBody": "As a long time fan of the franchise, I can say with certainty that the movie is good. Not spectacular, but good. By far, this movie has some of the smoothest and most beautifully executed animation of the entire franchise. Those who know this series know that the animation isn&apos;t always up to snuff, but this movie clearly got a much bigger budget and it was well served to seeing some very beautiful if even a little over-saturated animation. It&apos;s also wonderful that all the original voice actors of the characters represented in the movie made their return. It&apos;s a particularly wonderful thing of note considering that many of those voice actors are either retired or have switched focus to other areas and are no longer regularly voice acting on a consistent basis. I also like that 4Kmedia did not edit the movie to the point of being unrecognizable like they did with the original series. It was a very well executed English translation from the original Japanese property. However, if I have any point to criticize, it&apos;s that the story was a bit of a jumbled mess. It often felt like it was just jumping around from one thing to another without proper transition. It&apos;s likely due to the limited run time of the movie itself, but it often felt as if you looked away for only a few seconds or stepped out of the room for a few minutes that you missed major plot points and would easily get lost. I stayed in place for the length of the movie without leaving the room once, and I still felt like I missed something. That is a big issue for me. If I had been a casual viewer and not a fan of the franchise, I would have been so completely lost. That said, I still felt lost at times, and that&apos;s most definitely an issue of pacing. Whatever the case, it&apos;s a very good movie that any fan of the franchise will enjoy and those looking to get into the franchise should hold off on watching until they get to know more about the franchise itself. Above all, the ending was very satisfying. The action was lacking and rushed, but it reached an ending worthy of the era of the franchise.",

But overall this is a good, sweet one with plenty of action and excellent animation. Pen\u00e9lope Cruz sounds sexy (as usual), and Nicholas Cage is unrecognizable as Speckles the mole (I didn&apos;t know it was him until I saw the credits), but he&apos;s terrific. And though they appeared for a total of a little over few minute, Bucky the hamster (who is a quarter ferret) and the three mice were adorable.\n\nI&apos;ll recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good laugh on a lazy afternoon. And for the kids! 7* out of ten!",

The movie is so much better than I thought it would be (and that was bad) - I expected the comedy to be slapstick/junior/potty but it wasn&apos;t. The story was also good enough to keep my kids focused glued to the screen. The animation is wonderful. Music is tasteful. I can&apos;t imagine anyone but Jack Black pulling off the voice though - he definitely made the movie for me. The only thing distracted me was that most of the movie I spent trying to figure out who was doing the voice of Tai Lung (Ian McShane). As mentioned previously in the forums about the pop culture references in this movie - I don&apos;t remember one - very nice indeed - it works with some of the other movies but I can do without. This is the first movie in a while I&apos;d like to see again.",

Is Sacha Baron Cohen a genius of sorts or the biggest smart ass to hit the screens in a long, very long time? He makes John Waters appear like an (old) Disney product. The nastiness works because it is immediately recognizable and his targets live next door if not with me between my four walls. It is a social-horror-documentary. The three guys talking about women between beer and beer was so horribly real that I wanted to leave the theater laughing and screaming at the same time. Borat is not tender about his own background either. He is an equal opportunity offender if I ever saw one. The world is a cesspool and nobody is immune. Even his innocence is corrupt. I&apos;ve been considering seeing it again, as the whole thing in one single disgusting lump was too much to take but I&apos;m not sure I want to. I&apos;ll wait for the DVD where I&apos;ll be able to select and discard. My only question is now, what will Sacha Baron Cohen do for an encore.",

The cast of this film did an outstanding job with the voices of the characters, Jim Carrey is most notable in my opinion. Steve Carell also did an amazing job as the Mayor of Whoville.It also has good, clean humor that is both funny and suitable for all ages. I laughed through nearly 90% of the film and I didn&apos;t see one thing that would be deemed inappropriate for someone young. This movie lives up to the legacy of the book and I don&apos;t care what age you are, you will laugh out loud and enjoy this hilarious Dr. Seuss movie.",

Its been a long time since i&apos;ve seen an Anime that has peaked my interest so much, if you are a fan of Anime you will not be disappointed! Saitama (the main protagonist) is hilarious. Anime seems to have peaked recently due to the standard being set by shows such as Attack on Titan and I believe this show will set a new standard for Animes similar to its genre.",

   "inLanguage": "English",
   "heading": "A Timeless Disney Film With More Issues Than I Had Remembered",
   "reviewBody": "Peter Pan is directed by Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson, and Hamilton Luske, and is a post war Disney animated film about a young man named Peter Pan that lives in Neverland, a place in the sky in which no one physically grows up. When Wendy, a teenage girl living in late 19th century Britain, decides she doesn&apos;t want to grow up, Peter escorts her and her two younger brothers to Neverland, where an evil pirate named Captain Hook is out to get revenge on Peter Pan.\n\nMany older Disney films are considered classics, and Peter Pan is definitely one of them. From the characters, to the top notch animation, Peter Pan is one of the most iconic animated films of all time. Even 60 years later, most everyone has seen Peter Pan, from people who grew up with it when it came out, to children who are growing up with it today. Rewatching Peter Pan, however, I found a few problems with it that stand out along with all of the great aspects of the film.\n\nTo start, the animation in Peter Pan is absolutely timeless. Every hand drawn fame of the characters or environment looks amazing, and engulfs the viewer into the bright, whimsical place that is Neverland. All of the characters are also excellently animated, especially when in action. The two characters that stand out the most are that of Peter Pan and his rival, Captain Hook. This particular aspect demands that, in each scene, the viewers&apos; eye is drawn to either of the two enemies, which was a very smart move on the filmmakers&apos; part.\n\nOn the subject of characters, all of the voice acting is very good, with great performances being given by, specifically, that of Bobby Driscoll (as Peter) and Hans Conried (as both Hook and Mr. Darling). These two play off of each other brilliantly, washing away all suspicion of two men recording in a studio. The other actors also do very well, and aren&apos;t necessarily outshadowed by that of Driscoll or Conried.\n\nOne big issue I did find with Peter Pan was the pacing. It may be confusing to read, but the pacing in Peter Pan is so good that it makes a 77 minute film feel like 45 minutes. Each and every scene is so necessary that the film flies by very quickly. One blink could cause major confusion with how a character got from point A to point B, or where the characters even are. It may be hard to comprehend, but, once seeing the film, this problem is understandable.\n\nAnother issue I found with the film is the writing for Peter Pan himself. Peter Pan, as written in the original play, is a fun loving child that never grows up. He is supposed to be free- spirited, and a caring person. However, the script for this film seems to portray Peter as a cocky, selfish jerk. He feels as if he&apos;s above the Darling children, and, at points in the film, is pretty close to being hated by the audience. He begins to get a bit annoying, and has the viewer rooting for Wendy and her brothers, therefore indirectly rooting for Peter, rather than having us root for Peter himself.\n\nOverall, Peter Pan isn&apos;t as fantastic as I had remembered it to be. Is it a good, timeless film? Yes, it is, but it has a few more problems that I see more clearly now than I used to. Anyone who isn&apos;t too hard on films will enjoy Peter Pan, and others will, too, because it is a pretty good movie.",

   "reviewBody": "According to mythology the journey of life is splayed with different forms of hurdles, the path to salvation lies in standing tall against such hurdles even if the Gods are callous to your understanding. By maintaining hope we try to live up to their expectation, knowing that God will guide us if we keep fighting on our endeavor for greater good. That&apos;s pretty much the whole and soul of the movie. Opened first time in India at IFFI 2012 Goa, I was in the mix of lucky few who got to watch the repeat show of this 3D movie adapted from Yann Martel&apos;s book of same title.\n\nPiscine Molitor(Pi) Patel as he was named after a swimming pool by his dear uncle apparent by his ardent love for the same. Piscine is born Hindu in Pondicherry India, but as he levels a understanding he begins to peek into other religion and sooner he starts endorsing Christianity and Islam also. His father, a zoo owner pounces upon a chance of relocating the zoo to Canada. On their way to far west with animals on a Japanese ship, tragedy struck on a murderous stormy night capsizing the ship with Pi and a Royal Bengal Tiger left to see the remains. And so the adventures journey of innocent young boy with life threatening feline animal begins.\n\nThere was the thunderous applause from the audiences when the tiger gives his first appearance in the safety boat. Spending months to produce the Tiger didn&apos;t go waste too, he looked inch perfect and the way he has been handled in the movie is exquisite. The first few scenes are reminiscent of old India with bullock carts, later the landscape changes and so do the people. The characters of hot blooded modern day father, the supporting mother and the story involving the tender love between the protagonist and the girl are delightful however short they may be. The innocence of young Pi through his school years and his introduction to motley of faiths sets up the foundation to his uncanny characterization. But the real fun starts when they are both lost at sea and Pi tries assortment of ideas to keep him as well as the Tiger alive. The movie is never complete without the mention of adequately yet delicately used VFX. It would really be a shame to put into words those magnificently shot sequences and the scale on which the art work is done. This movie epitomizes the correct com-mixture of story with special effects. I could gather so many &apos;wows&apos; while I was myself devouring on the same scenes. The humor is well prevalent and does lighten up the few still scenes between the two.\n\nSuraj Sharma plays the most significant role in the movie with all his efforts and he wins it in the end. The guy is awesome handling some tough intense scenes in the movie. Irfan Khan playing the narrator as well as the older Pi shows his maturity in the business, patient with the small parts he never misses his character and his narration and dialog&apos;s delivery is to die for. Adil Hussain as Pi&apos;s father is superb with his character and does contribute a hell lot. Other actors contribute evenly including the computer generated zoo animals. Real salute to the art directors of the movie for putting up such beautiful pictures on screen. Ang Lee is as always incomparable with his cinema, he has definitely reached shore with this movie and a more versatile director in my book.\n\nThe older promises the character he is narrating that he will prove him that God exists, well did he or not? For that you have to wait for that amazing climax scene. This is art, storytelling and VFX at his best in a single movie. Who would want to miss that??",

I saw the movie at a pre-screening and every kid afterwards was smiling and excitedly talking about the movie. Sure there are some dumb jokes, etc., but overall the movie was great. It was especially cool to see Dick Van Dyke and Mickey Rooney working together.\n\nTake your kid to see this movie. Their imagination will go wild and they might even be curious to go to a history museum afterwards.",

   "reviewBody": "There is no reason, in terms of story, for Stranger Things to take place in the &apos;80s. But the &apos;80s atmosphere - the dial phones, the chain smoking, Winona Ryder - are there to clue you in on the inspiration for this movie, which is pretty much every supernatural movie from the 80s with a focus on kids. E.T., Poltergeist, that sort of thing.\n\nThe wondrous thing is how dead-on this tribute. It&apos;s not just the clothes and hair, but the style of acting, the scripting approach, the structure, all hold true to their inspiration. You&apos;ve got the young nerdy kids, the horny, unsure teenagers, the monster, the mysterious one with the power, the bad science/government people, the conflicted investigator, the tearful mom.\n\nYou could argue that this entire season is simply a pastiche made up of recycled elements, and I wouldn&apos;t disagree, but it really feels less like a copy and more like something of that era, as though the writers had fallen into a coma in 1985, woke up and got to working.\n\nWhile it doesn&apos;t have the high style of the Spielberg films that are a primary influence, it does have the likability. The story is consistently engaging and fun, the acting is excellent, and the movie has sufficient laughs and tears to satisfy.",

   "heading": "A Different Sort of Picture",
   "reviewBody": "Ex Machina (2015) \n\n*** 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nA different sort of science fiction film, a programmer (Domhnall Gleeson) wins what is basically a lottery to go and spend a week with his company&apos;s owner (Oscar Isaac). The owner, Nathan, pretty much created a search engine but he&apos;s gone a step further by creating an artificial intelligent woman named Ava (Alicia Vikander) who the programmer is supposed to examine and question.\n\nEX MACHINA pretty much came out of nowhere and became a good hit across the world and I&apos;m rather shocked that it did. Usually dumb science fiction movies with a lot of mindless actions are the ones that make money and not those that features very little to no action and instead just dialogue and thought. What really sets this film apart is the fact that it asks more questions than anything else and it expects the viewer to think about those questions and the impact that certain actions could have.\n\nThe visual style of the film is quite impressive and it&apos;s certainly a very interesting film to just look at. The music score is quite haunting and perfectly captures the mood of the film. There&apos;s the terrific cinematography that pulls you into the setting. The special effects are also extremely impressive. I loved the set and the look of this compound but the special effects are the real star. If you didn&apos;t believe that you were really looking at and operating with real artificial intelligent creatures then the entire film just wouldn&apos;t have the same feeling.\n\nThen there are the performances, which are a major plus. Gleeson pretty much plays the role that is typically a nerd but the film never lowers the character to that simple term and instead makes him a very interesting person. Even the role of the billionaire played by Isaac isn&apos;t what you&apos;d typically see and the actor brings a certainly coldness to the part. Vikander is flawless and steals the picture in her role.\n\nEX MACHINA certainly won&apos;t be a movie for everyone but it&apos;s good to think about the questions that it asks.",

   "reviewBody": "Rural Texas can be hard on anyone, even a rugged and tough Sheriff with a lifetime of exposure to it. No Country for Old Men exemplifies the grit of deep Texas and there&apos;s nothing better than a good chase. Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell balances his dangerous chase for a monster assassin with the equally dangerous chase for a good ole&apos; cowboy that comes down hard on the bad side of some very bad people.\n\nJosh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss finds himself in a dangerous dilemma when he brushes up against a bloodbath of a drug deal gone terribly bad and a satchel with 2 million dollars inside. The man looking for that money is a dispassionate and inexpressive villain, Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem. The rest ensues as a thrilling triple narrative, from a determined man with 2 million dollars on the run, only hoping to escape the mess that he stumbled upon, an old man sheriff facing an evil like none he&apos;s ever seen, and a psychopathic killer, an unstoppable evil with no remorse and a extraordinary determination to find what is his.\n\nWith its blood-soaked scenes, grimy West Texas setting and haunting terror filled moments between characters, No Country for Old Men is both riveting and beautiful. The dialogue is flawlessly delivered and the performances are award worthy. With almost no music in the entire film you&apos;re left immersed and focused on how the Coens utilize sounds and silence to score the film. From wind gusts and boot steps on wood floors and concrete, to deafening silence within the dialogue, it&apos;s a score that&apos;s frightening and precise.\n\n-Eric Statzer",

   "reviewBody": "I am a fan of the first Madagascar film, I know there are a lot of people who dissed it, but I thought it was cute. So when I saw the trailer for Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, I was excited. I saw it on Friday and I absolutely enjoyed this fun family film. I think this even had a more coherent plot as well, plus how could you not love the penguins? They are absolutely hilarious and need their own movie, maybe a Full Metal Jacket with penguins! Anyways, I loved the characters so much, they&apos;re back and better than ever. They even ended up giving the little old lady from the first Madagascar who fought Alex the Lion, she has a bigger role and was so awesome to watch and listen too. I think the jokes were even funnier than the first Madagascar, my favorite scene without a doubt was the plane sequence in the beginning. But the whole story was just a blast to watch.\n\nAlex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman are still looking to go back to Africa, everything seems to be a good and they start to fly back with the penguins as well as Julien. But the plane runs out of fuel and crashes, they are still in Africa, but bump into an animal pack where Alex finds his long lost parents, Marty finds out that all zebras are like him(imagine being surrounded by 1,000 Chris Rocks*shudder*), Gloria has a hunky hippo who is crushing on her, and Melman becomes the giraffe witch doctor of his group. Alex is about to be initiated into his pride, but one lion does not want him part of the group and will do anything to become leader.\n\nMadagascar: Escape 2 Africa is definitely worth your watch, it&apos;s not the animated film of the year, but it was a lot of fun to watch. It kind of reminded me of The Lion King a little bit, it has a similar story. It&apos;s a great family film and is fun for both the kids and the adults as well. Although I still think it&apos;s funny that Alex is voiced by Ben Stiller and his dad is voiced by Bernie Mac, but it&apos;s all good, who knows, maybe Alex&apos;s dad just had a little more soul in him. I would recommend this film, it was a lot of fun to watch and I suggest we write in a script for those penguins! They&apos;re a blast to watch on screen.\n\n7/10",

I had brought the kids to see a few other animated movies before this like Wreck-it Ralph and Rise of the Guardian, but they turned out to be somewhat boring and unengaged. So I went into this not expecting much, it was more for the kids. To my surprise, I LOVED IT! It&apos;s different, funny, smart, and adventurous. I found myself giggling through most of the movies and at other times astounded by the visual effects. I also see my kids and other kids sitting at the edge of their seats at times. It is great for all ages. The picture was stunning and saturated with imagination. Dreamworks has outdone themselves with this one. I highly recommend taking your family to see this!",

   "reviewBody": "The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances by a grand ensemble cast. From set and production design to cinematography, from script to presentation, Christopher Nolan has once again demonstrated why he is one of the film world&apos;s brightest up and coming directors. The Prestige only helps solidify his standing as one of the landmark directors of his generation.\n\nTold in a narrative that jumps between various points along its time line, playing out like a magic act itself, the story is that of two magicians on the rise in their careers. The first -- played by Christian Bale -- is an expert in understanding the fundamentals of any trick, but lacks showmanship. The second -- played by Hugh Jackman -- is a master showman who is more entertaining than technical. A tragic series of events pits the two performers against each other in a battle of wits that spirals further and further out of control, consuming both of them and everything and everyone they care about.\n\nWith a story that requires actors with a great deal of emotive range, Nolan has assembled what could be described as a dream cast. Both Bale and Jackman suit their respective roles perfectly, and pitting these two performers against each other was a stroke of casting genius. Michael Caine takes what could have been a forgettable role by any lesser actor and elevates it with his demanding screen presence. Probably the most surprising performance comes from David Bowie whose unforgettable turn as master physicist Nikola Tesla absolutely shines. Add Andy Serkis to the mix, and what is assembled is a group of performers who know how to fully engage the audience.\n\nThe Prestige is hard to pigeonhole into any specific genre as it walks the fine line between mystery, drama, suspense and fantasy. In that, the story becomes a never-ending stream of wonder for the mind: one can never tell exactly where the story is going to lead next, becoming more and more as time goes on. This gives Christopher Nolan ample opportunity to play. And play he does. With narration by several characters, each adding their own viewpoint to the events, and with a direction that moves between time to mystify and distract, the end result is a climax that itself is a series of puzzles that each unravel beautifully.\n\nThe only major criticisms that can be leveled at the Prestige are a confusing play with the seasons during Tesla&apos;s introduction (winter suddenly becomes spring/summer and back again) and a strange choice of music for the closing credits (a pop song at the end of a film such as this seems tacky). However, neither is significant enough of a problem to warrant any need to avoid the film at all.\n\nIn the end, the Prestige is a fantastic display of what can be accomplished when you bring together superior talent. It is certainly worth the price of admission and as good as any magic show you are to come across.",

The story focus on the technical aspects. However the movie is never slow, it keeps moving and keeps you interested. The casting was good. Octavia Spencer, Taraji Henson, Janelle Mona, and Kevin Costner did an incredible job. There was also wonderful performances by Jim Parsons and Kirsten Dunst. Hidden Figures is a fun and exciting movie about advancement in ideas and technology. Its is also a very uplifting movie about bravery and taking chances. It is really good. I enjoyed it.",

The premise of the film seems quite superficial at first but as the layers are peeled back there&apos;s so much more beneath.\n\nIt&apos;s a horror film without special effects gore, an action flick without any car chases. A high-tension psychological thriller for viewers with active imaginations, who don&apos;t need to be spoon-fed every explanation.\n\nThe acting is top-notch, the script sympathetic, the cinematography and set fantastic, and the music/sound subtle enough not to be noticed, consciously, while building the tension inexorably. It&apos;s gripping, un-turn-away-able.\n\nSeriously impressive. I don&apos;t give 10&apos;s lightly.",

   "reviewBody": "Like many other people, I was also thrilled upon watching the Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer trailer at the cinema. Similar to numerous people who adore CGI, read the comic books when they were kids and thought the first installment was decent enough to justify a sequel, I was more than willing to get myself ready to be overwhelmed by the mere strength of the eye candy and CGI effects within the film. And then I watched it at a special press screening in Ramat Gan, Israel. \n\nTo make a long story short, FF2 is not a bad film. I was actually quite entertained throughout wide parts of the film (particularly at the beginning - but more on that later). Problem was, once I stepped out of the theater, I couldn&apos;t actually recall anything specific or special about what I have just seen (other than that cool CGI Silver Surfer, that is). It was just so mediocre in terms of plot, direction and acting (somebody really ought to give Jessica Alba some acting lessons a.s.a.p), that I didn&apos;t even care enough to remember it. Furthermore, while the original film required some suspension of disbelief, let&apos;s just say the plot in its sequel stretches this boundary one step too far, IMO. \n\nAs I&apos;ve already mentioned, FF2 actually starts up in quite a promising manner. While Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue (Alba) get ready for their media circus wedding (think Tomkat style - but bigger), strange electronic and climatic disturbances occur across the globe. From here on out, you have this huge build up that pays off about half an hour into the film, continues with a bang and some dazzling CGI shots, and suddenly ends abruptly while the initial novelty of the Silver Surfer&apos;s appearance wears off. As usual, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm steals the show as the only character to truly evolve during this film, Mike Chiklis as Ben is seriously under-used, my 1.5 year-old nephew could play better than Gruffud&apos;s Reed and Alba isn&apos;t even that pretty anymore. Then you have all these villains (Silver Surfer is definitely not working alone, as implied in the IMDb official plot line) and some twists and turns that leave you feeling mildly entertained, but also incredibly under whelmed. \n\nYou see, if you&apos;re looking for mindless big-budget fun, this is the place for you and your bucket of popcorn. However, don&apos;t expect to find the heart of Spider-Man 3 or epic feel of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&apos;s End. Don&apos;t even look for credible acting or intelligent plot. Only decent thing you&apos;ll find are some good looking money shots, and mindless action sequences. This formula of a film may work well as a matin\u00e9e, but not as something you&apos;ll want to come back and watch again in the coming future.",

There is an air of self awareness about the story that, rather than disengaging, is used to draw the viewer more into the inherently ridiculous story. There is an artistry to suspending disbelief, and this is an endlessly creative way to get the audience to do so. To make them aware they&apos;re getting conventional information or that certain things are ridiculous plot details, even tropes, and highlighting such details to actually enhance the storytelling rather than distance the viewer. After a point you accept the strange pacing and rapid editing style as part of the universe of this film, and when you do , The Isle of Dogs is an audio-visual experience so cathartic you won&apos;t want it to end.",

Tied together with tasteful cinematography (with necessary hidden cameras here and there), Tickled captures the enigma of David D&apos;Amato&apos;s empire of male-tickling videos which results in scare tactics, harassment, and financial bullying of the unsuspecting participants--something that is very relevant to modern issues. I felt sad walking out of the film, which is evidence that this film does its job of riding the line between comedy and tragedy. I do feel that the trailer sets up an expectation of a horror/thriller aspect, but there is not much of this atmosphere in the film. I do, however, think that the film by itself is a brave piece of journalism that endangered the Tickled team financially and psychologically. The fact that the team was able to muster up the courage to finish the film is remarkable, and I hope David and his team are brought to justice.",

From laughter to tears, it&apos;s an emotional roller-coaster during the entire movie. The first part of the movie I kept thinking that it was well done but nothing more. But then I grew into the movie. The more the movie advanced the more I really liked Patients. I will gladly watch this movie again in the future. About everything is good in this movie, the soundtrack, the story, the cast, the photography, everything. Not only you get to watch from close by how hard it is to keep the moral high when you become a quadriplegic or another handicap. Some patients do everything they can to get better, other have just no hope or courage. It&apos;s not easy for anybody, from patient to caregiver. The movie made me think a lot, how fast our lives we&apos;re used to could turn. It made me realize even more that you should be thankful for every second you&apos;re in good health and to try to keep it that way. Enjoy life at the fullest while it&apos;s still possible. The cast was sublime to watch, every single character was well thought of and brought something special to the movie. A must watch if you ask me.",

   "reviewBody": "The story starts in Africa, we see two miners chiseling out a piece of mud/rock that has beautiful old opal pieces imbedded. Not long after this same uncut gemstone is sent to a NY jeweler stuffed inside a large fish on ice. Not the way you would expect a legal transaction take place.\n\nThe recipient is Adam Sandler as jeweler Howard Ratner, this shady transaction is indicative of everything that follows in the movie. Ratner is as shady as a Washington politician. He is only vaguely acquainted with truth, honesty, and fidelity. If that isn&apos;t enough to doom him he also has a gambling problem and we find him deep in debt, barely managing to stay afloat. He hopes auctioning the gemstone will allow him to pay off his debts. Plus he and his wife have agreed to a divorce because of his philandering.\n\nRatner is a mess, but other than his wife and kids, so are all the other characters in his life. This is a very well told and well made movie of despicable characters. My main takeaway is being happy that my life is totally different from theirs. Sandler is superb here as a totally despicable person who doesn&apos;t seem to be aware that he is totally despicable. Even when his wife says something to that effect to his face he seems surprised.\n\nThis is not a movie I&apos;d like to watch again, I&apos;d guess most fans of mainstream movies would not enjoy the 2+ hour viewing experience. The language is beyond awful, F-this and F-that, to the point you want to wash your ears out. However I am glad I took the time, it is a viewing experience.\n\nI watched this at home on BluRay from my public library. Not my wife&apos;s kind of movie.",

It is a beautiful film, with the most glorious soundtrack, a feast for the eyes and ears alike.\n\nI&apos;m sure there was a social message here, it was perhaps over my head, what I saw was a good old fashioned love story, one with a difference, and a load of eggs.\n\nIt&apos;s sad, moving, funny, it&apos;s definitely very, very weird, but if you&apos;ve seen any of his other movies, then you&apos;ll realise the inevitability of that.\n\nIt&apos;s a unique watch, and a rewarding one, 8/10.",

Merlin the wizard has plans for the young orphan Arthur.\n\nThe animation is classic hand-drawn style. It has an old-style charm that is reminiscent of TV cartoons of that era. It&apos;s educational at times. It&apos;s pretty light weight humor. The story is pretty thin. It doesn&apos;t put in enough time for a compelling villain. It also suffer for not having a beautiful princess or an interesting lead. Arthur is too flimsy to be a compelling child character. Merlin and Archimedes are really the only fascinating characters. It&apos;s also missing any great songs. The best part of the movie is the transformational battle between Merlin and Mim.",

   "reviewBody": "Why is this movie so funny? And why is it universally judged to be so by people who don&apos;t understand French culture? I have asked myself this question while watching it for the Nth time and while asking myself why most Hollywood &apos;comedies&apos; made today are not funny at all. I believe that the answer is that the basis of all comedy is to make fun of someone. Here, fun is made of sexual stereotypes, of the British, of the French and, most of all, of the Germans, Nazis in this case. Hollywood has become so politically-correct that it now only dares make fun of a WASP male in a business suit, and of no one else. Take the case of &apos;The Birdcage&apos;, a remake of the French comedy &apos;La cage aux folles&apos; made some 20 years earlier. Being bilingual, I can testify that the original version is immensely more funny than the Hollywood remake. That is because the Hollywood bean-counters, who like to pass themselves off as artistic decision-makers, toned down most of the fun that had been made of homosexuals in the original movie. Ask Shakespeare or Moliere: the play or movie will be funny only if it pokes cruel fun at someone, provided it is not at you. Sorry for the politically-incorrect opinion.",

   "reviewBody": "I write this review just after hearing of Stanley Kubrick&apos;s death. It&apos;s a great loss, and I write about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, because I feel it is the consummate Kubrick film, the one he will be most remembered for. It is a picture like no other, not only revolutionizing science fiction, but changing the way films are conceptualized. It was probably America&apos;s first &apos;art&apos; film and has inspired the likes of George Lucas and countless other writers and directors.\n\nAside from its visual greatness, the reason the film spawns so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, his co-writer, had a vision, but we have never really found out what was going through their minds. Of course, the skinny on its &apos;message&apos; is how technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful. 2001&apos;s ending is one of hope, a version of our rebirth through the star-child&apos;s flight back to earth. It is meaningless to many, but discerning filmgoers will understand.\n\nAlthough 2001 does not have the wicked, dark humor of DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or contain strong, eccentric characters that filled his earlier works like PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still feel he would&apos;ve liked to be remembered most for this. If anything, HAL will be his most memorable character, dangerous, murderous, and artificial. It was a half-decade in the making at a time when Hollywood was still churning out dull musicals and just waking up to the New Wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was a maverick director who made great films on his own terms, his own time, and for everyone else to marvel at. He will be missed.",

   "reviewBody": "As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.\n\nThat&apos;s not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.\n\nThe film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.\n\nIt&apos;s a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.\n\nHowever, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride.",

   "reviewBody": "This is a hugely enjoyable film, based upon the book by Roald Dahl. The film does have a number of merits, especially the flawless performance of Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, a characterisation that is charming and funny at the same time. Another standout is Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, his scenes with Charlie were lovingly realised, but in his song, he was just hilarious, and his singing voice was remarkably good. However, whereas Peter Ostrum is perfectly agreeable in terms of acting as Charlie, he is let down by his lack of any real singing ability. Though the film does look beautiful with excellent cinematography and colourful sets, and the supporting characters like the Oompa Loompas, the odiously spoilt Veruca Salt, television addict Mike Tevee and the rather disgusting Violet Bueragarde, are very well done, and the actors are further advantaged by a wonderful sparkling script. The songs are lovely, especially Oompa Loompa, Imagination and I want it Now, though I will say I felt Cheer Up Charlie was rather tedious and slowed the film down quite considerably. Overall, a beautiful film, and I do think it is underrated. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",

   "heading": "The best acid trip experience that can only be felt once in a lifetime!",
   "reviewBody": "Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you&apos;re walking on an acid trip experience. It&apos;s an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.\n\nAnd this movie deliversssssssssss that! Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick & Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!\n\nProduced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it&apos;s such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What&apos;s even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.\n\nThis film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It&apos;s fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there&apos;s just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.\n\nEEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.\n\nMichelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb, is excellent in this, proving that she&apos;s fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she&apos;s doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It&apos;s not easy to play her role and it&apos;s definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.\n\nThere were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you&apos;re forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it&apos;s just funny you&apos;re having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it&apos;s aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you&apos;re watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you&apos;re watching. You&apos;ll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!\n\nIf there&apos;s one dislike from this film is that it&apos;s gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.\n\nVerdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime. We&apos;re only in March but without a doubt, this is already the best film of the year! Sorry, summer blockbuster movies!",

They all do a bang up job in that regard. So no trouble so far. The movie looks good. I have no complains here either. It&apos;s technically very well made. We always see what&apos;s going on, no shaky cam or anything like that. Some nice shots too. The humor works pretty well, the dialogue comes off as natural. I like the beginning of the movie, the family is pretty likable. The movie is sort of a mystery, and when the mystery unravels is when we get to some slight problems. The scrips seems to be based on a pretty good idea, that was never thoroughly worked out. It just isn&apos;t thought all the way through. I am left with several questions, and not in a good way. This is spoiler terriroty, so I won&apos;t go into detail, but it didn&apos;t sit well with me. Doesn&apos;t seem to make sense. The plot has more holes than a swizz cheese. (that almost no critics talk about this is very strange)\n\nNow, in the movies defence, the sub-genre it turne out to be is very far from my favorite, so others might like it better. I&apos;ve seen a lot of horror movies, and this is just not one of the best ones. It is mediocre. Not a weak movie, but definitely no classic. Will not be watching it again.",

   "reviewBody": "I loved this movie as a kid, as did just about every person I know. So it works for the youngins. As an adult, and an animation fan, I was surprised to learn that this movie is sort of the Disney studio&apos;s secret shame. I had nothing but fond memories of it, after all. And I could name at least a dozen Disney films that I would have put ahead of it on my Most Crappy list. I very recently watched it on television after many years, and yes, it is definitely flawed. The quality of the animation is terrible, and the lack of an over arching story makes the whole thing seem frivolous, like it was made for TV and not for a big studio release. There are holes in the narrative, scenes that should exist that don&apos;t, and scenes that have no reason to exist that do. And I think the somewhat random decision to cast the film with animals lends to the Saturday morning vibe as well.\n\nBut there&apos;s enough cool things peaking out from under all the half-assery that rescues the film just enough for it to be enjoyable. Peter Ustinov turns in an excellent, excellent performance as Prince John, at turns hysterical and genuinely nasty. Brian Bedford oozes easy going charm as Robin. He&apos;s probably turned in the second most likable performance of the character captured on film. He&apos;s just unfortunately delivering it through the poorly animated mouth of a cartoon fox. And though the actual quality of the animation is poor, some of the character animation is pretty clever and expressive. And I have to applaud the choice to add Roger Miller to the mix as a folkie, possibly pot-smoking minstrel rooster. His character adds a cool, Earthy vibe to the proceedings and as others have mentioned, his song, Not in Nottingham, actually sort of works as a blues song. Weird.\n\nSo Robin Hood is definitely not the epic tale Disney was capable of churning out in its hey days, but I dug it as a kid, and I still dig it today. You know, looking back at all my reviews on this site, it seems I mostly leap to the defense of classically bad films that I like anyway. That&apos;s OK, I guess. Someone has to.",

The movie opens with an extended scene at night of local residents going to the school gym for a basketball game, just to set the mood of the time, and it all feels authentic.\n\nBut things get going when the teenage girl goes to her job as phone switchboard operator and her good friend, a slightly older guy, goes to his music and talk show at the tiny local radio station. Some electricity goes out, some phone calls get disconnected, some strange sounds are heard, coming from the skys, and recorded. All leading up to a strong belief that alien beings are in the sky.\n\nThe movie is interesting and very well made, considering it had a tight budget and a short shooting schedule. The dialog is mostly interesting and the main actors are very good in their roles. It all takes place at night on one day which adds to the mystique.",

The amazing trick here is how Lee seems to very cleverly shift from laugh out loud comedy to troubling sometimes fairly intense scene and back without missing a beat.",

   "reviewBody": "Taxi Driver is one of the best films ever made. This is one of those films that you do not get tired of seeing and every time you watch it you realize a little detail that you have not seen before. Excellent actors, a good director, an impressive soundtrack and a real story are the main appeals of this film.\n\nThis film is about loneliness, about the isolation of a man in a society full of scum. His objective is to finish with the scum of the streets. The story uses a taxi driver as a metaphor of loneliness and it has some kind of irony because we can see that a city which is full of people can be the most lonely place for a man. The long nights in the city, the night environment full of whores, junkies, pimps and thieves are the main elements of the world in which Travis Bickle lives. Travis is an misunderstood guy who is seeking desperately for some kind of company because as he says &apos;loneliness has followed me all my life, everywhere&apos; but at the same time he seems not to do anything to avoid his situation and it is seen when he goes with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) to a porn cinema. At the end of the film the character makes real his most violent fantasies, with a look of certain soldiers from Vietnam, and he behaves like this because of his loneliness, his alienation and because he does not find any sense to his life. The violent behaviour becomes Travis into a hero, although he had killed many people and he could do it again. Although he acts with an extreme violence the spectator understand him and the reasons why he acts that way. The soundtrack of the film, which is composed by Bernard Herrmann, inspires some kind of loneliness and sometimes it is absolutely terrifying like in a horror film. This music and the slow camera showing the streets help to introduce the spectator into the world of Travis, to know what he is thinking about.\n\nIn general I cannot say any negative aspect of this film because I have not found anything bad. Although it is a film of the 70s it is not an old-fashioned movie because the essence of the story, the reality that is shown on it, can be perfectly referred to the current society. This film has the privilege of having made famous the sentence \u0091You talking&apos; to me? You talking&apos; to me?&apos; which will remain in the history of cinema. This is an authentic masterpiece.",

   "reviewBody": "I may be the only person to say this but I think The Rescuers was a LOT better than the sequel. Oh don&apos;t get me wrong, Down Under&apos;s pretty good. But, to me, The Rescuers is the best.\n\nSince I was a little kid, I have had a short attention span so movies with more action generally held my attention. The Rescuers and the Pooh films were the two exceptions for me. This isn&apos;t a very fast moving film, at times it&apos;s quite slow. But that&apos;s when the tension builds. You feel a certain warmth watching it, similar to the warm fuzzies you would get from a Pooh film. It&apos;s sweet. It&apos;s fun. The characters are lovable and the villains are detestable (I mean Madame Medusa kidnaps an innocent little girl and then forces her to go into a dangerous pirate cave, if that isn&apos;t evil, I don&apos;t know what is). Even the supporting cast is awesome, if not entirely memorable. I think there were too many critters at Devil&apos;s Bayou, had they cut the cast down a bit, perhaps I could remember them all. But that&apos;s literally my only complaint.\n\nThe film is slow but it doesn&apos;t feel slow. It doesn&apos;t lag at all. It keeps you completely focused on the characters. By the way, the acting is superb, particularly Michelle Stacy as Penny. Usually child actors are hit and miss but she does an excellent job, she really makes you feel for Penny and that&apos;s the most important part. Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor as Bernard and Bianca. They really bring the characters to life.\n\nThe animation is beautiful as well. It all seems like a painting come to life. I am particularly impressed with Bernard and Bianca&apos;s animation because they look a lot like their voice actors. So you can&apos;t imagine a better voice for them. You often forget that they&apos;re mice. And that&apos;s really impressive.\n\nSo, all in all, this is one of Disney&apos;s best. Ever. It&apos;s proof that the animation studio was still going strong after Walt Disney&apos;s death. And it&apos;s still one of my all time favorite movies. I say, check it out. There&apos;s something for everyone in it.",

This doesn&apos;t have a dumb plot and boring and dry attempt at a scare like most horror movies these days (particularily insidious). This movie is actually a seriously taken and very well done horror movie, very weird and confusing plot that adds up over time, very beautiful cinematography and amazing acting, vey good characters. Good and creepy tone to the movie and great ending reveal. Very well done and great horror movie.",

   "dateCreated": "2011-01-27",
   "inLanguage": "English",
   "heading": "A Truly Delightful and Indulgent Little Movie",
   "reviewBody": "This is one of the most rewarding pictures I&apos;ve seen in a long time. It&apos;s a breath of fresh air from the usual mainstream hokum, mixing black comedy and dry humor with genuine warmth and empathy. It&apos;s a movie you don&apos;t want to end, but when it does, you kinda want to give it a big hug.\n\nThere are no cheap laughs or lame gags here - the humor bubbles along like an undercurrent, echoing real life. Life is a constant source of amusement - we just have to recognize the fact and tap into it sometimes. \n\nThe storybook device, where the protagonist speaks directly to the audience, was perfectly weighted, cutting in at just the right moment to pace the movie and remind you of the pretext. \n\nAll the characters were well-rounded and authentic - I was particularly impressed that Craig&apos;s psychiatrist was played totally straight. The temptation to have her do or be something slightly crazy or contrived must have been great, but it was thankfully resisted. Likewise, the inmates of the psychiatric ward - there&apos;s a charming and utterly believable sense that everyone&apos;s a bit off kilter, rather than jokingly deranged. \n\nThe patients in the film aren&apos;t the butt of the joke - society and its proclivities are. That said, as a British viewer, I found it more difficult to appreciate how academia and peer pressure drive school-kids to anti-depressants and therapy - and for them to be impressed by the fact. I probably missed some of the main messages and in-jokes of the film, being from Yorkshire, rather than New York.\n\nNevertheless, I don&apos;t think you can fail to love this film. Zach Galifianakis is adorable, Emma Roberts is gorgeous and Keir Gilchrist manages to combine confusion and teenage erudition superbly. \n\nIf nothing else, you have to love the self-indulgent interludes, especially the 3D animation through Craig&apos;s fictional, line-drawn world and the wonderfully camp group performance of &apos;Under Pressure&apos;. The soundtrack is spot on right to the last - who knew traditional Egyptian music could be the saving grace?",

   "reviewBody": "In a film like The Empire Strikes Back, especially a few years on the heels of such a mind-bogglingly great film like the original Star Wars, there is something that comes immediately to mind that would at first seem to count against the film, but instead only winds up increasing the respect that it commands. In the 1977 Star Wars, there is a clear reliance on simplicity in some parts. Obviously, it is much more than a simply made science fiction film, but like I said in my review of it, there was a lot of highly effective reliance on things that were not put on screen, such as Obi Wan&apos;s description of The Force to Luke. In The Empire Strike Back, the first thing that we are treated to is the traditional scrolling text along a background of stars, depicting what has happened between the last film and this one, and reminding us of the things that were mentioned in the last film but never explained.\n\nAt first, this would almost seem to be a way to save money to get more information across to the audience without having to actually put it on screen, but this is really an ingenious way of furthering the story. The very fact that we are so willing to read all this information and forgive our inability to actually see it is a testament to the quality of the series, even at this early stage in its presentation, and we know the story so well from the first film that we are glad to see such a large change in what&apos;s happening in the films, not for a second lamenting the fact that we have obviously missed so much action. And besides that, if and when George Lucas runs out of new prequels to release, and maybe if he someday begins to run low on how many hundreds of millions of dollars he has, he could go right back and make these in-between scenes into full length films. What would he call these, if he did that? Introquels? Who cares! The names themselves would be interesting enough, and if you go back and read the stuff that introduces this film, it&apos;s obvious that there&apos;s an entire film there just waiting to be made. I guess the question of actors would be a formidable one, though.\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back is the film where we are first introduced to the great Jedi master Yoda (`Away put your weapon!&apos;), as well as some of the most thrilling battle sequences of the entire Star Wars series, and that includes the prequels. The battle scene where the rebels fight the Imperial Walkers on the ice planet is an incredibly well-made battle scene, not only in the way that it was put together so convincingly using models, but that the machines themselves are so creatively made. Indeed, the Imperial Walkers are some of the most recognizable machines from the entire Star Wars saga, right up there with the Millennium Falcon and the Death Star.\n\n I have just watched this film again, having already seen Episode I and Episode II, and not having seen any of the original Star Wars films for maybe 10 years (except for the original 1977 Star Wars, which I saw and reviewed a few days ago - and these aren&apos;t even the Special Edition versions!). When I first saw Yoda when watching The Empire Strikes Back again, I was really struck by how different he looked from in the newer movies. Obviously, he&apos;s completely computer generated in the new films, but here in Episode V he looks like a muppet! Even so, I would like to express my opinion that Yoda is more realistic and more interesting here as a puppet than in the newer films as a computer generated image. At least here in the older films you know that he&apos;s actually THERE, and that he&apos;s not just added into the film later.\n\nOh yeah, speaking of Yoda, can I just complain for a minute? What the hell was up with the Jedi training? Yes, I realize that I&apos;m just a lowly IMDb reviewer, while The Empire Strikes Back is a part of the greatest science fiction series of all time, but would it have killed George Lucas to write in a little more creative training for Luke? The thing that struck me first about the Star Wars films when I first started watching them was how incredibly imaginative they were, but then Luke started his training. You know, when I was in high school I played football. I was a wide receiver/tight end and I hardly ever got to play because I was too tall and too skinny, but part of my workout was to carry the linemen up and down the stairs to the weight room. Some of these guys weighed 100 pounds more than me, and I still almost never saw the field, and here&apos;s Luke Skywalker. He carries Yoda around this boggy swamp and he gets to be a Jedi! What the hell!\n\nThere is also the addition of a surprisingly fitting love story. First of all, anyone who has ever read my review of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie will know that I am not the biggest fan of cramming a love story into a movie where it doesn&apos;t belong. I can&apos;t seem to write anything about Bruckheimer movies without complaining about the idiot love story, and now it&apos;s even worse because here&apos;s this movie that was made so long before, from which Bruckheimer could obviously have at least learned a LITTLE bit about how to do it right. Han Solo and Princess Leia maintain the personalities that they developed in the first Star Wars film and there is now a sort of love/hate relationship between the two of them, where neither one of them wants to admit their feelings for the other. This romantic subplot is characterized perfectly in the scene just before Solo is carbon frozen, when Leia risks approaching a cheesy romantic moment by saying `I love you&apos; just before Han is lowered into the freezing chamber, and he saves the moment by responding, `I know.&apos; Han Solo. Smart-ass to the last drop.\n\nBefore I end I would like to point out that the goofs that can be found on the IMDb for this film are some of the most blatant that I&apos;ve ever seen in a film. The scene where you can see someone giving a woman at the tactical maps a cue to deliver her lines is amazingly obvious, and some of the other ones, such as the stage hand swinging the light saber prop briefly into view as he switches it for an `off&apos; prop with Luke just after he knocks Darth Vader over backwards, are just as much fun to look for. I have one question about the goofs, though. There&apos;s one where Luke looks off into the fog just after R2-D2 is eaten by the sea monster, and you can CLEARLY see a person running to the right a little ways off in the fog. Is that meant to be Luke? It seems that it&apos;s supposed to be him running in his search for R2, because you can even hear the FOOTSTEPS of the person running. I can&apos;t even IMAGINE how they could have missed THAT!!\n\nIt is, however, a testament to the quality of a film when such tremendous oversights in editing do nothing to take away from the overall quality of the film. The Empire Strikes Back remains an extremely powerful and well-made installment in the Star Wars series, not taking even a single step backwards in the sheer breathtaking adventure of the original film. It&apos;s not often that a film as good as Star Wars can be released and then followed up with a sequel that is just as great, as is clearly the case here. Star Wars was a gigantic film upon its release, and with The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas has begun the formation of one of the greatest film series&apos; in cinematic history.",

I remembered that I had to pry my eyes open during the middle part of Da Vinci Code. It is long, not much suspense and consists of babbling about. Yawn. But Angels & Demons, the sequel, is more intense, has more suspense and action. Tom Hanks gets not only to exercise his brain but also his legs. The adventure requires him to move from one place to another.\n\nThe story: Tom Hanks plays symbologist Robert Langdon. He has to solve a murder and at the same time, prevent a terrorist act against the Vatican. This time, he has Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) to help him solve the mystery. The mystery plot and intense peril scenes kept me on the seat. Hans Zimmer&apos;s beautiful score makes the movie more epic. The adventure is an intense ride but not as intense as I thought. The sets are amazing too.\n\nOverall: Fans of the book will flock the cinemas to catch this. Fans of the previous movie, Da Vinci Code, should also catch this. Those who like thrillers, this one may suit. This is supposed to be a fictional thriller which is not to be taken seriously.",

   "reviewBody": "Low expectations were what I had when the trailer first appeared on my phone screen. I wasn&apos;t even interested to watch it &apos;till the end. I would roll my eyes on the animation style, it&apos;s not eye-catching nor it is impressive.\n\nBut damnnnnnnn! I wasn&apos;t expecting it to be good. It&apos;s a feature animated film filled with genuine laughter, comical characters and an above the par plot.\n\nThe caper team consists of Wolf, Tarantula, Piranha, Snake and Shark, all of which play a different archetype from one another. This team of 5 is evil and yet, you might find that their personalities are very likable, charming and even approachable. This is the heart of the film, the element that keeps the audience entertained aside from its narrative.\n\nOcean&apos;s 8 meets Zootopia, this is what The Bad Guys is. You may find the first heist somewhat similar to the all-women Ocean&apos;s. There&apos;s the restrooms, kitchen tray trolleys, red-carpet staircases, hackings (pretty much every heist film), red laser traps, all of which resemble strongly with the mega heist of the Met Gala in the said film. I found TBG better than Zootopia, which I PERSONALLY found it to be overrated. However, those who love Zootopia will also enjoy TBG as it implies similitude to it.\n\nRunning for over 100 minutes, The Bad Guys never stops with its steady pacing, putting audience in an enjoyable ride from start until the end.\n\nLo and behold, you wouldn&apos;t expect how many twists they are in this. It&apos;s a plot twist on top of another plot twist. Just when you thought, there you go, they have revealed all the twists, the film comes in with another unexpected twist , showing that you have also been deceived by The Bad Guys. When you look back at it, it&apos;s amazing that all the twists don&apos;t come as a force, but rather it oozes naturally, making it a perfect fit to the whole story.\n\nThe animation style is better than what I had visualized in my mind. Looking at the trailer, I thought it was mehh, but the pencil-like motion drawings got better as time went on. It took a bit of time to adjust but eventually, I liked it.\n\nOn the other side of the cell, I believe that TBG should offer a larger team than mere 5 animals. It would have been so much fun, exciting and the stakes would be even higher!\n\nAll the animal outlaws are excellent however, I must say, I&apos;m a little disappointed with their back stories, because there is almost none to begin with. They did introduce each member in the beginning, but I wanted to know where all of them came from, how they can coexist and walk the earth with humans, and how the group was formed in the first place. I know, I&apos;m aware this is an animated film but what a solid story they could have to an already excellent plot.\n\nRounding up, The Bad Guys is definitely in my top 5 films of 2022 as we almost end the quarter of the year. Let&apos;s see what the future has in store for animated films!\n\nVerdict: If there is one thing The Bad Guys taught us, it&apos;s to never judge a film by its trailer.",

   "reviewBody": "Stephen King may have said the master director knew nothing about horror, but that simply is not true. That is a too biased opinion for anyone to go on given that he wrote the book, which Kubrick based his wonderful film ever so loosely on. And at any rate, faithful or not, KUBRICK&apos;s Shining-the BEST crafted genre film of the 80&apos;s- performs it&apos;s duty as a fright flick, and then some.\n\nThere are appropriately no words strong enough to convey the haunting beauty of the visuals showcased throughout the movie, from the drive to the Overlook to the final chase in the hedgemaze the movie is a feast for the eyes as it is for the mind. And it IS a feast for the mind as The Shining is as psychological as horror gets, toying relentlessly, and expertly with your emotions and expectations(some could even say SADISTICALLY), throwing something in that&apos;s completely out of left field and never, ever letting you catch your breath between the now classic shocks as the movie speeds toward it&apos;s memorable conclusion in the last half hour.\n\nKudos are in order for Kubrick, a director of the old school style, who builds an eerie atmosphere by exercising total control over the filmic environment, manipulating everything down to the tiniest detail to suit the needs of the picture, yet filming with a coldly detatched, objective eye, as though Kubrick were making a documentary about these events. This would account for the dialouge, which-thankfully-is not the typical phoney balloney Hollywood banter (Kubrick detractors/King purists usually bitch about this the most, having been weaned on the phony nature of &apos;Hollywood talk&apos;, which is usually nothing at all like real talk. Many of us speak &apos;on the nose&apos;, and do not try to convey subtext through use of carefully chosen words that articulate our state of being without being direct.) In this light, Shelley Duvall must be commended for her performance which is very naturalistic. It does not seem like acting at all. She is not concerned with glamour, nor does she clutter her performance with typical acting chops, but rather she is solely focussed on hitting the emotional highpoints of her character as &apos;Wendy&apos; gradually comes to realize that her husband is a madman. And let&apos;s face it folks, how many of us would like a million bucks when placed in a situation like that? Who does NOT look like a blubbering idiot when they are hysterical? That&apos;s what I thought, so what did you expect? She was great. To say nothing of the rest of the cast.",

At times the movie grows slow and drawn out, but that is intentional- to make you feel like you are trapped in an underwater coffin with nothing to do, no where to go. The directing is great, the sound is fabulous! I&apos;ve never heard faint noises tell a story like this before.",

   "reviewBody": "When deciding whether or not to see this film, the question is very simple: Do you like Wes Anderson&apos;s previous work? If you answered yes to this question, you will adore The Darjeeling Limited. If you answered no, you&apos;d better spend your money elsewhere. I personally, fall very deeply into the former category. I&apos;ve always been a huge Anderson fan and adore all four of his previous efforts, and this certainly ranks among his best (top three, easily). This is a much more guided, inspirational and personal work from the man. While his other features have been more minimalistic and set between a certain group of characters, Darjeeling takes on a much larger world.\n\nThe story is about three estranged brothers, Francis (Owen Wilson), Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman). About one year ago their father died and they went their different ways. Of course, nothing can start off too happy in a Wes Anderson world. Francis attempted suicide (the irony is painful), Peter is having a baby with his wife Alice who he always thought he would divorce and Jack is trying to get over a rough break up (some inside jokes for those who have seen Hotel Chevalier are included). Francis decides to reunite these brothers on a spiritual journey across India, via train, and everything happens to go horribly wrong.\n\nThe chaos that ensues is quirky, hilarious and utterly perfect for fans of Anderson like myself. The performances from the three leads are brilliant, particularly Adrien Brody whom I thought was going to be out of his Oscar-winning element but actually fit in so well that I preferred him to the rest of the cast. There is a huge turn into a more somber mood about halfway through that brings up memories of Luke Wilson&apos;s big scene in The Royal Tenenbaums (nobody tries to commit suicide, mind you) and the film picks up on the dramatic sentiment before jolting right back into the uniquely brilliant world that always keeps my sides in stitches. The man&apos;s genius is as strong as ever. This may be his best film and it&apos;s certainly his most poignant.",

Meanwhile, lifelong bully Brent relishes in tormenting Flint just as he did when they were kids, and Mayor Shelbourne schemes to use Flint&apos;s latest invention--a device designed to improve everyone&apos;s lives--for his own personal gain.\n\nOK, I admit it. The trailer for this film looked average, compared to other animated flicks, especially the films from Pixar. I thought the film would be too kiddy for me and that the storyline was beyond lame. I mean, food falling from the sky doesn&apos;t draw people in, does it? Oh, how wrong I was. I think we just found the third contender for the best animated movie section in the Academy Awards, people! Not only is this much better than non-Pixar animated films that has been released in SOME time (I think the last was HAPPY FEET?), but it&apos;s also one of the most visceral, inventive, entertaining, ingenious, silly movies that I&apos;ve seen this year! Oh, wait. This is the only one.\n\nI felt like a kid again when I put my 3D glasses on. Things popped out in a flashy fashion and the movie told in a quick pace with zippy dialogue! I wanted to grab the delicious-looking foods on the screen, from hotdogs to ice cream! It&apos;s like being a kid in a candy store! There&apos;s so much craziness here that I can&apos;t even dare to describe! When was it the first time that you saw a talking monkey that ripped a heart out from a live gummy bear?! When was it the first time that you saw a live turkey eating a human being?! Everything in this film is so ridiculous and preposterous that you have no choice but to go along with the ride\n\nThis is also a very, very funny film with a laugh per minute with some really clever jokes scattered throughout the film. But don&apos;t worry. There&apos;s a story in here too. It&apos;s been quite a while since I&apos;ve seen a good father-and-son film (the last was FINDING NEMO?), but this film succeeded in that department as well. The message is by no means blatant and preachy at all. The cast is also a splendid delight, Mr. T standing out as one of the top characters because you can never really escape his noticeable voice. Bill Hader and Anna Faris did a wonderful job in their roles as well.\n\nOh, and did I mention the film was a visual feast (no pun intended)? You will see things in here that you have NEVER seen and probably will never see again in any other film. This should automatically get you a ticket to the theaters because when are you ever going to see a talking monkey grabbing a heart out of a live gummy bear?! WHEN?! The 3D technology is near flawless. It&apos;s probably the best looking 3D I&apos;ve ever seen, the image looking very sharp from background to foreground. I also found the score by Mark Mothersbaugh to be amazing and exceptionally memorable.\n\nIf there&apos;s one bad thing I have to say about the movie, it isn&apos;t as good as Pixar&apos;s storytelling. However, CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS should be a movie you should watch in theaters because it&apos;s unlike any movie you have ever seen. There&apos;s a lot of ingenuity and inventiveness and cleverness that is warped around the movie. The film is entertaining for both the kids and the adults to enjoy, so there&apos;s no need to worry. But wow, was this film a spectacle. If you have the chance to see this in 3D, see it but I&apos;m sure the 2D version works just as well. If you&apos;re iffy about the trailer, I guess that&apos;s a good thing because the movie surpasses the trailer by ten times. Prepare to get served...literally.",

I was pleasantly surprised. The practical effects were a very welcome change to the cgi I was used to. They were done so well that I was at no point removed from the illusion. To this day, they&apos;re still the best I&apos;ve seen. It&apos;s proof that if done right, practical effects such as animatronics will always beat out cgi.\n\nThe movie is fantastic in every way. Kurt Russell is such a good actor that I&apos;d have to class him as one of my favorites. Carpenter and Russell were a tour de force in the 80s creating both The Thing, and Escape From New York.",

   "reviewBody": "I had gone into Paprika not knowing much of what to expect, save for the fact that it was an anime with quite a buzz. An hour and a half later, this is one of the best films I&apos;ve seen in 2007.\n\nThe plot, as best as I can describe it, concerns a group of scientists developing a device which allows one to interject your subconscious into and record another person&apos;s dreams. However, a thief is using the technology to terrorize and control others. As the scientists try to find their stolen property, reality begins to take on a different meaning...\n\nSatoshi Kon is filmmaker I&apos;ve never heard of before, but what he has created is truly visionary. Paprika continually amazes with imagery which transcends conscious understanding and coherence for what can only make sense on a subliminal level. Examples include a marching band of inanimate objects, dolls and animals, a giant aquatic leviathan with a man&apos;s face and humanoid toys that act as vessels for their dreamers bodies.\n\nBut what makes the film necessary viewing is not the visuals alone, it&apos;s the core of the story and varied themes that it poses. The subject matter deals with issues both contemporary and probable. The actual identities of ourselves are wrapped in an enigma. How science has its positive and negative aspects. That the advantages of the internet is better communication but also dehumanization. I&apos;m sure others will find other symbolism and subtext.\n\nWheather you&apos;re familiar with Japanese animation or not, Paprika will expose any newcomer to something foreign and deeply personal as well.",

   "reviewBody": "I&apos;m happy to report that everything established in previous movies pays dividends in a big way. It&apos;s not that anyone needs to see those other Avenger solo films before seeing this gem but it certainly adds depth and texture to this amazing product. Not having to intro big main characters deeply allows the action to flow but also allows for better development. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character&apos;s personalities. This heightens the tension, so often missing from comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the story as well as the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. The result is a film that&apos;s just flat out exceptional.\n\nOf course all the phenomenal heroes got to shine and the story accommodated them all perfectly. What I loved is that Marvel did it again with their main villain. Loki was just so wonderful and complex in this amazing movie. Spurned Loki masterfully dances on the fault lines of villainy and redemption. He always keep people guessing and. Again, that&apos;s just shear perfection coming from the god of mischief. He has such a mixture of emotional psychological complexity. You have somebody who&apos;s capable of thinking and strategizing at the speed of light, but underneath that is a deep well of pain that at any moment threatens to boil over and Tom Hiddleston plays it like the master he has become. This is Oscar worthy villain performance good.\n\nThe performances in this movie are as good as any I&apos;ve ever seen in an adventure film. The great actors say that acting akin to playing tennis. The rally that they play with a new partner is completely different from one to the other. Each of these GREAT actors have such specific talents that it&apos;s fun to see them play off each other at different times in this movie. I think Whedon realized this as both director and writer and shuffled things around on purpose to play to strengths. It&apos;s just another wonderful aspect of this spectacular movie event.",

   "reviewBody": "At the tender age of 26, when I still thought no film was complete without a car chase and a big explosion, Amadeus had me hooked. I went to see it multiple times back in 1984 during its initial release, back when the theater was empty whenever it played and before it was nominated by the Academy.\n\nThis film is an unusual biography, and I often like to compare it with Ed Wood, since both Ed Wood and Salieri were men who gave everything they had to their respective crafts and came up short. Salieri, a contemporary of Mozart, has only one dream - to be a great composer. Predating the prosperity gospel by about two hundred years, Salieri mistakes obsessing with God over his own earthly desires with actual godliness, even being happy when his father - who objects to Salieri&apos;s musical interests - chokes to death and leaves Salieri free to pursue his musical dreams. He chalks this up to God&apos;s will for his career. Problems begin when Salieri meets a twenty-something Mozart at the court of the Emperor in Vienna, where Salieri is the court composer. Mozart is everything Salieri is not - profane, forward, and a great composer. Salieri starts down the road to insanity as he realizes the childish Mozart has all of the gifts he ever wanted and has been denied. However, Salieri is not an outright failure as was Ed Wood. In many ways he is something worse than a ridiculous failure - he is mediocre, and worse yet, he knows it.\n\nSalieri,angry at God for honoring a profane ungrateful boy like Mozart while ignoring his own one desire to be a great composer, swears to destroy Mozart. The strange thing is, as long as Mozart is alive, Salieri is the honored composer, not Mozart, though this just seems to infuriate Salieri even more. Salieri seems to be the only person in Vienna who recognizes Mozart&apos;s talent. This just begs the question - why did it never occur to Salieri that being able to recognize something as valuable before anyone else does is a talent in and of itself? After all, in 1975 the second best thing to being Bill Gates would have been to have recognized his genius and invested heavily in his success. But I digress.\n\nThe cinematography and art direction on this film are outstanding. The visuals start out light and festive, matching Mozart&apos;s mood and prospects. As poverty, illness, and the guilt of his father&apos;s death close in on Mozart during the second half of the film, the mood and visuals become very dark to match what is happening in Mozart&apos;s own life. Highly recommended.",

   "heading": "An entertaining experience, but unable to match the sheer brilliance of the original.",
   "reviewBody": "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is the second of the Indy films from director Steven Spielberg, though chronologically it is actually the first. This prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark tries to out-do its predecessor for breakneck spills and gross-out moments, but the sparkle isn&apos;t quite there. It&apos;s an entertaining film for sure, but not as good as the original, partially because the plotting this time round is a little awkward and partially because Kate Capshaw as the main female character is an almighty irritation.\n\nThe film opens in a Shanghai restaurant, where Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) causes a riot in pursuit of a diamond. Fleeing the scene with American singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and teenaged pick-pocket Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), he escapes to the airport. However, Indy and his companions unwittingly board an airplane owned by one of Indy&apos;s enemies, from which they have to make an audacious mid-air escape when the real pilots bail out mid-flight! Soon, the intrepid trio find themselves in India, where they come across a village in the grip of starvation. The village children have been kidnapped by local cultists to work in a mine, digging for the sacred Sankara Stones, and Indy is persuaded by the distraught villagers to rescue their youngsters. His quest takes him to the opulent Pankot Palace and, beneath it and beyond a maze of tunnels, the Temple of Doom.\n\nFord is great as Jones, bringing genuine charisma to a role that he was born to play (can you imagine how things would have turned out if Tom Selleck had got the part, as originally planned?) There are some great moments along the way too, including the intentionally subversive opening sequence in Shanghai, a particularly funny and exciting runaway mine-train sequence, and an unforgettable banquet at Pankot Palace in which the food served up is enough to churn any stomach. But Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom still can&apos;t live up to the standard set by Raiders of the Lost Ark. As mentioned, Capshaw is a real pain on the senses as the always-squealing heroine, and the plot seems to over-stretch in an effort to link to the next development or set piece. The hunt-for-the-missing-children plot device allows Spielberg to dip into the kind of cloying sentimentality that occasionally mars his films too. This is certainly an entertaining and professionally assembled film, but in no way a rival or an equal to the excellence of its predecessor.",

   "reviewBody": "Brilliant, captivating, and sometimes just plain awesome are some of things that come to mind while watching yet another one of Miyazaki&apos;s epic tales: Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Winds. Deliberately slow-moving at points, yet undeniably exciting in and out of it&apos;s action sequences, and a fantastic introduction to anime itself.\n\nWithout revealing too much of the plot, it takes us through the life of Nausicaa, a princess of a small village, and her struggles to stop warring nations from destroying an important source that can save the planet. The planet has already gone through a major destruction that nearly wiped out humanity, and their are large insects called ohmu, that guard the source that is spreading through the world.\n\nMiyazaki introduces an empowerment of female characters in his animes, such as Princess Mononoke, Kiki&apos;s Delivery Service, and his most recent, Howl&apos;s Moving Castle (Hauru no ugoku shiro). The characters are done with style and care, and, in Nausicaa, there is no exception.\n\nIt amazes me that this film created some controversy when released, being banned in Poland because of it&apos;s depiction of an ecological disaster. Though the movie is obviously fantasy, it turns out that some may consider it a touchy subject. I didn&apos;t find any offense whatsoever with anything the movie showed, just a futuristic disaster no doubt caused by man.\n\nCombining fantasy and science-fiction, Nausicaa is nice to look at. It certainly shows it&apos;s age when compared to some newer animes, not having the help from high-end computers. Considering it was done in the 80&apos;s, Miyazaki&apos;s production team did a great job. Little details, backgrounds, gadgets, & animals are drawn slightly better then some Japanese animes from that time.\n\nKeep in mind that my review is based on the Disney release (Feb 2005). It&apos;s cleaned up, unedited, with new voices from well known actors that sound great (but I still prefer subtitles). Keep far away from the old version &apos;Warriors of the Wind&apos;, which chops off more then half-hour from the movie.\n\n9 out of 10",

Writing about it just to blast it and all that and how stupid it is is kind of redundant. Uh, really?. There has never been any question, doubt, or any misconception about what these films are or like. People know what they are and they know what they are going to get when they rushed to the theater to see it or watch it now. They obviously liked the way it was and the simple, mindless fun it delivered, because if they didn&apos;t, then the movies would not of been as successful or popular as they were, or had so many made. I definitley know many scholary people who enjoy movies like this because they are fun and innocent and let you have a fun side. It&apos;s alright to like PA and any of it&apos;s sequels.",

He comes to help resistance member Hillary Flammond on the run. He is imprisoned and beaten. He manages to escape to a secret lab with Hillary&apos;s father Dr. Paul Flammond who is forced to develop a secret weapon against submarines.\n\nThe team of Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker follow their highly successful Airplane! with this spoof of a Presley and spy movie. It has the same sense of irreverent fun. Val Kilmer is pretty good but there is nobody equivalent to Leslie Nielsen in this movie. Also going back to Elvis Presley from the 60s is not as immediate as the disaster movies that were still in the conversation of the day. Overall, it&apos;s a fun little film.",

   "reviewBody": "I&apos;ll start out by saying that I&apos;m a Stephen King fan and thus I may have some bias. I&apos;ve watched many Steven King movies but have never given one a rating this high. Most of his horror movies are in the 4-6 range with classics such as The Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, and The Green Mile ranking 8-10 (although two of those aren&apos;t technically horror movies). In most modern horror (like the Saw series) there is a greater emphasis on gore than the horror of the human condition and this movie, kudos to the actors, help weave a tale that disgusts you inside and out without the pure reliance on blood spatter (although granted there is a fair amount of that).\n\nThomas Jane (leading male and well known from The Punisher) has a brilliant and emotional portrayal of his character in a mind-blowing situation that we feel intimately associated with thanks to his acting and great directing. Laurie Holden (of X-Files and Silent Hill fame) has a more subdued performance but plays her role well and for any X-Files nut (such as myself) it&apos;s fun to see her in another movie. The cast is chock full of well known actors and some unknowns that really see and express the writer and directors vision. It pays off: They succeed in pulling you into a traumatic situation made worse with a mixture of religious zealotry, military conspiracy, and small-town ignorance that explodes in your face wondering if your humanity is worse off facing The Mist or the human condition.\n\nThere is no spoiler here but I will say this about the ending: It&apos;s what makes the movie and makes it so much better than most of the crap put out there in horror land. Yes, yes, getting cut in half and having limbs ripped-off is horrible. However it is the decisions we have to make that concern those we love and respect that can really drive one mad. The ending makes you look at yourself and wonder, if given the same situation, what you would have to do with the information you have available. It makes you think hard about your humanity and your soul and about what is right or wrong in any given situation involving our mortality.\n\nI would suggest this movie to anyone that likes horror or science fiction and wants something a little more intense than, say, Army of Darkness (one of my personal favorites for totally different reasons). This movie deals with serious issues we hear about daily. The mist is just a piece of Science Fiction thrown in to bring out the best...and worst in us.\n\nEnjoy!!",

Bomb techs, of course, are those heroic individuals who get called when a bomb or other explosive device is discovered. Their job, under life and death pressure daily, is to defuse the bomb and make things safe for the rest of us. Unfortunately, in war environments, this is a daily occurrence. What kind of person can do this kind of work? How do they do it day in and day out? Someone has to be a little crazy to do this in the first place, don\u2019t they?

   "heading": "a Container for Your Own thoughts",
   "reviewBody": "This struck me as a documentary or, more fairly as a personal yet direct meditation on the own words of a man, embedded in context, which may also be a definition for documentary I was deeply impressed by the honesty of this film. I understood where Soderbergh, the artist, was, as i felt the space he left for me to think. How he uses Che&apos;s own expression of the part of his life depicted in the film, with the least possible manipulation (editing the book is already manipulating) and still, it&apos;s up to the viewer to place his own opinions over what he saw - more or less distanced according to where we come from and where and how long we lived. Of course this is made considering that who goes to the film has a previous knowledge of what context and moment, and what character he is about to watch.\n\nI&apos;ll put this film together with Medem&apos;s &apos;La pelota vasca&apos; (an assumed documentary) for they both show an extreme sensitivity working with such delicate themes as like they choose to work. Both originated some contesting, More with Medem&apos;s because the director was more rooted in the problem that was shown, and because the story is far from being closed, but to me they were both opened films which, as any contemporary film should be, leave a lot of the thinking to the public, and work as brain starter for discussion.\n\nThe narrative structure is effective, the artwork and editing are of great competence. Che in the woods of Sierra Maestra, on the verge taking the power in Cuba inter cut with his visit to the USA, in 1964. This second line is shot in black and white, the other has beautiful colors. The absence of music was a mildly risky choice i appreciated. The rest, you can think of it yourself. I thought Del Toro was very good, internally concentrated, resisted totally to being what we expected Che to be, and that&apos;s something, to be able to interpret a character with such an charismatic aura behind him, which we can still feel when his own words are spoken. From this film on, i admire Del Toro; before this i didn&apos;t look at him as i do now. I&apos;ll review his previews performances, i have to check if i didn&apos;t notice how good he is. Quite on the contrary, Bichir, as Fidel, was a total disaster, frankly one of the worst performances i&apos;ve ever seen. How could he think Fidel was all about imitating a voice, some gestures, and handling a cigar. What a mess.\n\nOf course this man&apos;s story is controversial, which means one can make radically opposed opinions out of the same known and accepted facts. The fair amount of arguments i&apos;ve had since i saw it with someone who saw it with me prove me right here. I think Guevara was a lucid man, who read perfectly well the mechanics of the world of oppression where he stood. He chose to stand there and live like them, though he wasn&apos;t like them, and that&apos;s worth admiration. The ideas he made of the injustice he saw was a product of a genuine mind. But though the diagnosis was right, the whole process of making it in practical terms was a mess, to my eyes. He was at the root of a regime, inserted in a bigger regime, that grew on arrogance, on hypocrisies, and at a certain point became at least so unfair to the same oppressed people as those oppressed had before. And that&apos;s because, though wanting to do different, this revolution used the same weapons of strenght and physical superiority others had used. And that killed the whole idea. And Guevara was there, with it, being oppressive when he thought he was being better, out of, i think, ingenuity. What i say is, read the man, his observations are probably equally (or even more) correct today as they were when he made them, but don&apos;t follow his steps, i wouldn&apos;t, not knowing what i know today.\n\nAlso, notice how Che, the icon, grew to incredible proportions, 3 reasons i give it: \n\n-He died young, and fighting for ideals, at least shooting for ideas; \n\n-He was picked up by the very capitalism he rejected and was sold like an icon the population (mainly youth) desperate to get out of the contradictions in this regime, check the contradiction of this; \n\n-He had an image standing for him, literally an image, the photograph Korda took. It&apos;s amazing, and it&apos;s probably an unique case, how a single image can move millions, how the right moment, with the right publicity can be so powerful. If you think about that, among the capitalists who sell tshirts and the liberals who believe Guevara, this is image is the center of the most successful publicity campaign ever. Once more, i admire Soderbergh&apos;s intelligence to leave that image out of this film. It&apos;s more than avoiding a clich\u00e9. It&apos;s avoiding the viewers to go recall clich\u00e9s they&apos;ve made (me included) over that image.\n\nMy opinion: 4/5\n\nhttp://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",

   "reviewBody": "I watched How to Train Your Dragon about 5 times now, and it never gets boring. It actually keeps on getting better and better with with more and more views. This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. It is an amazing experience to watch this film in Cinema. The 3D is amazing and at times Breathtaking. I may of had the most fun that I&apos;ve ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon.\n\nThe script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth. This movie is for everyone. Adults and Kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end. This movie will probably become a series like Shrek. But I&apos;m hoping this film doesn&apos;t get bad sequels like Shrek 3 and Shrek Forever After. Anyways this film will be most recognized for its beautiful animation.\n\n10/10 Highly Recommended",

   "reviewBody": "Over the years I&apos;ve become quite a sucker for Pixar movies and just love each and every one of them. While there are the states of the art animation and sound effects, the stories have heart. The characters are adorable yet real. It reminds one of those charming movies Disney used to make but Pixar films are very much a unique cinematic experience. \n\n&apos;WALL-E&apos; is quite unusual compared to the previous Pixar movies. There&apos;s hardly any dialogue between the two protagonists other than saying each other&apos;s name. In fact, barely a word is spoken in the entire first half hour but WALL-E and Eve&apos;s silent and playful love story is such a joy to watch. Even though of few words, both characters have strong personalities and the character development is wonderfully done. \n\nThe animation is colourful and vivid. Sound effect is amazing. The robot characters are cute and charming. The score deserve special mention as it&apos;s mesmerizing and beautiful. Andrew Stanton has done a terrific job as director and co-writer. The portrayal of WALL-E&apos;s loneliness and need for love is very well done and then the change that is brought within after the entrance of Eve and his eventual determination to rescue her is effectively shown. There are many genuinely funny and creative moments and it manages to stay away from being &apos;just plain silly&apos;. The story is rich with humour, action, drama and adventure. \n\nBen Burtt and Elissa Knight do a fabulous job with the voice acting for WALL-E and Eve. John Ratzenberger, Kathy Najimy and Sigourney Weaver lend great support. While &apos;WALL-E&apos; tells a magnificent love story it reminds us that Earth is our home and nothing can replace it. It&apos;s a joyous magical experience and another sure winner from Pixar.",

The animation is that classic Disney style and (thank Goodness) it lacks all of those annoying songs. \n\nAs a true Sherlockian, I can only say that this is as good as it gets as far as Holmes goes. No matter what everyone says, It is still great. Kids may not get some parts f it, but every Sherlockian knows what&apos;s going on. While Ratigan may be no Moriarty, he&apos;s still the perfect example of the classic Disney villain. \n\nVincent Price is a terrific actor, and Alan Young as Flaversham was the perfect fit. Young Susanne Pollatschek is the perfect Olivia and no one could do a better Basil than Barrie Ingham. Val Bettin makes a lovable Dawson. Fidget is the classic evil crony. \n\nThis is absolutely a must see. For all you baby-sitters out there, and I know from personal experience, take this to your next job and the kids won&apos;t even blink for over an hour. It&apos;s one of the most memorable Disney movies of it&apos;s age. Although Beauty and the Beast will always be my favorite, GMD runs an extremely close second! \n\nI give it 11/10! It&apos;s that good!\n\nI always say when I write these, I loved this movie, but you may not. So how do you decide if you like it? See it! Form your own opinion! After all, one man&apos;s trash and all like that! Hope you find a good one!",

   "reviewBody": "Let&apos;s get this out of the way first: I&apos;m not a huge fan of DreamWorks Animation. Usually consisting of nothing more than unfunny pop culture gags, I think the majority of their films are mediocre at best, with the only ones that I really enjoyed being the first Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. The trailers for Monsters vs. Aliens did get me interested, though, and the voice cast seemed pretty impressive. Even so, I was still fairly skeptical about how it would finally turn out. Now, having seen the film, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised.\n\nThere isn&apos;t a whole lot in the way of story and character development, but suffice it to say, it serves its purpose. What makes Monsters vs. Aliens such an enjoyable film is how it works as a comedy. The pop culture references are still present, but I found them to be more clever and funny this time around, and in much smaller amounts. I was smiling through virtually the entire film, and had about 5 or 6 hard laugh-out-loud moments throughout. As expected, I was also very impressed by the voice cast in this movie. Hugh Laurie does a fantastic job as the voice of the sophisticated (though mildly insane) Dr. Cockroach, and most of the laughs are generated by Seth Rogen&apos;s performance as B.O.B.. Even Reese Witherspoon helps you feel some sympathy for her character near the beginning of the film, and Stephen Colbert does a surprisingly solid job as President Hathaway.\n\nThe 3D, while not used as effectively as it was in Coraline, is still one of the more impressive showcasings that I&apos;ve seen, and that&apos;s largely due to the film&apos;s incredible action sequences. Seriously, this is some of the best action that I&apos;ve seen in an animated film; as far as I&apos;m concerned, it&apos;s right up there with that of The Incredibles.\n\nOverall, I found Monsters vs. Aliens to be a surprisingly entertaining film, with clever and witty dialogue, as well as terrific action. I&apos;m not usually in favor of sequels, but if they&apos;re able to keep it as balanced and charming, I would honestly like to see this become a successful, long-running franchise. Nice job, folks at DreamWorks Animation.",

   "heading": "Fantastic, magical movie!!",
   "reviewBody": "This is a classic fantasy film from Jim Henson, in collaboration with George Lucas. There really is a magic about the film and that has helped it last as a firm family favourite all these years. As with many films aimed at younger audiences there are messages that the writers, in this case Henson himself, have tried to convey, such as `be careful what you wish for (as in the heat of the moment we are not always sure what is best for us) and also about not taking things for granted. These lessons not only relate to the major target audience of young children but also teenagers and adults alike. The film also has values and attitudes about growing up, the central character Sarah is in the awkward stage between child and womanhood, the stage of adolescence. She acts like a child in her self importance and possessiveness but she is perhaps starting to grow out of her young imagination. She does not want to, her room full of inanimate companions, dreams and fantasies, she feels are slipping away.\n\nLabyrinth is about Sarah keeping her imagination alive, her fantasies and dreams, and these help her figure out what she is doing wrong, it helps her realise how her attitude is wrong and causes her to be depressed. There is certainly intelligence to this film if analysed deeply. There is depth to the script, and clear attitudes and values that Jim Henson conveys. Henson is in a way telling not just kids, but also adults, that our subconscious, which includes our dreams and imaginative side (in terms of taking yourself to another place, more than imagination in creating something like a piece of music for instance.) can be as affective a guide to where and when your live is going wrong as your conscious. Sometimes we don&apos;t realise things we have said or done until we dream. How many times have you said something, that every teen must have to their parents, for instance `I wish you were dead&apos;, very cruel but it is said. I have in the past and realised the full implication in a bad dream, a dream is the most effective doorway to imagine something outside of it really happening. \n\nWhat is fantastic about the way the film opens and closes as that it really hints to the fact that Sarah has been through the same dream before, and that she needs these imaginative friends, and dreams to help her see the light as it were. She says for instance at the close that every now and again she needs Hoggle and company. The opening of the film sees Sarah reciting from a book to herself, she is addressing the Goblin king and the characters of this book and her room are the cast of a play inside her mind, they are special to her and meaningful, in a way we might have a favourite song that speaks to us in some way. At the start of the film when we are first in her room there is clever use of visual hints that you wouldn&apos;t pick up on until watching a film the second time. Look around her room and you see the characters everywhere, Hoggle, Ludo even a little replica of a maze. There is also a clipping of Sarah&apos;s mother, who we do not know whether she is still alive, but in any case is not around, but she is with a man who is the likeness of the Goblin King. The man in the photo probably a figure of blame for the loss (however large) of Sarah&apos;s mother. What is also interesting is Sarah being a young girl at the start of puberty has a certain fascination and perhaps crush on the Goblin King, perhaps a combination of the character from the book and the likeness of which she has created this character in her head. Certainly on a visual and script basis there are some clever touches when you consider this is a kids film. \n\nThe film itself is much like the Wizard of Oz in terms of story (intentional maybe as it could represent something that Sarah finds special and perhaps inspirational). What I really love about the film is, that before the days of CGI, inside the Goblin world, which accounts for 90% of the film, everything is 100% set work, there must be well over a hundred sets and they are all imaginative an create the enchanting atmosphere of the film, these sets combined with some fantastic matte paintings from ILM that give even more of a scale to the film.\n\nI do really like this film, the look, the cheesy feel good 80&apos;s music, the characters, it is all great. There is some good humour and of course the odd piece of very childish low brow humour but that is to be expected. It is movie magic no question. David Bowie is good as the Goblin King and all the puppeted characters are fantastically brought to life in there movements and voicing as you would expect from a Henson film. A very youthful Jennifer Connelly before the days when many a website was devoted to her ample bosom, has a charm to her, she has to hold the movie together and win the audience, especially after being very bratty and effectively wishing her baby brother into the clutches of Goblins. She does manage to win the audience though and enchant them with her green eyes and youthful innocence.\n\nThis film is great, it is what makes, or made fantasy films of this time really enchanting. Real artistry was involved, there was exuberance and charm to it and it has lasted a long time. It is a firm fans favourite and still gains new young fans. I can still to this day sit down and enjoy the film because I remember what Jim Henson tries to teach us. `Keep the inner child alive inside you sometimes he/she actually knows best&apos;. Perhaps certain events in recent years may have panned out differently had this been heeded by more people, but that is all just hear say.\n\nOverall this is a classic fantasy film with much artistry and charm to appreciate, certainly Henson had a skill in all his fields in the industry. ****",

   "heading": "Kubrick - yay! One of the best war-based movies ever",
   "reviewBody": "I like Kubrick&apos;s stuff. Generally any movie he directed was several notches, in quality terms, above any other director (particularly those working nowdays). Does `Full Metal Jacket&apos; continue to show the mastermind behind `2001&apos;, `The Shining&apos; and `Dr. Strangelove&apos;? Yup, it does.\n\nAs plots go. there isn&apos;t much here. I don&apos;t particularly care because the script makes up for it. `Full Metal Jacket&apos; is very much a movie of two halves - the first half dealing with a group of conscripts in training at military camp and the hardships they endure under their `hard-as-nails&apos; instructor. The second half is about their exploits in Vietnam itself. Fights? In &apos;Nam? Haven&apos;t we seen all that before? Yes, but rarely with such an experienced hand at work. And it&apos;s the camp scenes that are so wonderful.\n\nGustav Hasford et. Al. have produced an excellent script, particularly for the opening hour. There&apos;s barely a moment&apos;s pause before you&apos;re thrown into the screaming face of Sergeant Hartman. He&apos;s hurling abuse at his new recruits with lines so forceful and sharp they&apos;ll have you gasping in shock while simultaneously laughing in incredulity. It&apos;s the way the script runs in without a pause for breath that helps so wonderfully - and the fact that it&apos;s so powerful. It&apos;s never just about one-liners from a sergeant, it&apos;s also telling a story about how humans work under these conditions. The first half is about how they suffer under their own at home (and very well told it is too), the second half about the human condition under the duress of war. It&apos;s an interesting comparison, and a tale well told. The battle may lack some sort of overall context or resolution, but then I feel that&apos;s in keeping with the movie - it&apos;s about the individual, and not the war, and such elements cannot be easily quantified.\n\nAll the characters have a grounded `real world&apos; feel to them, due to both the material and the versatility of the actors. R. Lee Emery is viciously delightful as the manic Sergeant Hartman, while managing to add occasional touches of humanity and a `this is for your own good&apos; attitude through subtle gestures. Matthew Modine is the amiable lead, Private Joker, and as such balances the hard and soft edges admirably (if not spectacularly). The other stand out though is Vincent D&apos;Onofrio as Private Gomer Pyle, the recruit picked upon by Hartman and the other cadets. There&apos;s a wonderful innocence about him in the beginning, which transforms into a frightening hardening of his soul later on. The evil/beyond-hope look he gives later on (anyone who has seen the movie will know the one I mean), remains as the most frightening look I&apos;ve ever seen depicted onscreen. All in all the cast accredit themselves well here.\n\nAnd so to the direction. It&apos;s Kubrick. It&apos;s good. Once more there&apos;s excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. There&apos;s some lovely use of filters (that haunting blue). There&apos;s a brilliant subtle score, that&apos;s eerie when used, but never intrusive. There&apos;s a very good command of pace - the viewer is never left idle or bored, and the story (particularly in the tremendous first half) flows along smoothly. Great touches abound throughout - check out the many examples, such as the opening scene of Hartman marching right up to the recruits (and to the camera), spitting and screaming vindictive comments, almost as if at the viewer. Some may criticise the almost disconnected feeling you have in the battle scenes towards the end, but I found their stillness, their quietness, and raw power, far more effective than the flash-bang wizardry employed in tripe such as `We Were Heroes&apos;. I can blather on about Kubrick for ages. so I&apos;ll stop now.\n\nIs `Full Metal Jacket&apos; perfect? Not quite because of the `two halves&apos; syndrome. Although they do contrast and complement one another, the first half is very much the stronger half. The second feels weaker against it. In and of itself the second half would normally be regarded well, but it doesn&apos;t have the visceral power that the first does. I love both bits, but I do love one bit more. This makes the movie suffer just a little. There&apos;s so much to like here though that I can&apos;t criticise too much - and so much to cherish (especially in the lines delved out). Once more the main man succeeds. Definetely worth seeing. 9/10.",

The movie is very smart and suspenseful. The screenplay of the movie is intelligent and will make sure that you are glued to your seats. Direction and cinematography is good.\n\nActing is great and Jake Gyllenhaal is mesmerising. Vera Farmiga is superb and Michelle Monaghan is memorable. The movie presents superhero in a new form without costumes and special powers but doing the same thing of saving the world.\n\nA must watch movie with an great ending.",

   "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a Shyamalan fan. He&apos;s not afraid to take chances. And he believes in himself and his story. Most of the time, that helps. Gems like Unbreakable en The Village would never have seen the light of day if someone other than Shyamalan came up with it. His direction always makes sure his story gets the maximum effect. I like his screenplays because they always consist of two things: originality and well written characters. His new feature has neither. It&apos;s that simple. As a Shyamalan fan, I felt this disappointment a little with Lady in the Water. But now, it&apos;s twice in a row.\n\nIn a nutshell: Beginning in Central Park NYC, people are effected what is first believed to be a neurotoxine causing people to behave irrational, even to the point of suicide. But then the survivors start to uncover signs that it&apos;s not terrorists, but nature itself spreading this virus: yes, it&apos;s nature against men. And nature is winning.\n\nI thought Wahlberg was a very poor choice. His range as an actor is far too narrow to play in any production that needs a little nuance. In other words: he shouldn&apos;t be in anything else than a movie about cops or (ex-)marines. Also the rest of the cast is surprisingly aloof. This includes Zooey Deschanel, who looks like she&apos;s a live-action version of a Manga character. Can those eyes be any wider?\n\nThe way the information is brought to the viewer is simple. There is a hinge of a critical message about massmedia, how we get our information and how we as a society are depended on TV, mobiles phones etc. to get in touch with each other. But it&apos;s nothing major. Because there really isn&apos;t much to tell. The first 15 minutes are the most interesting. Although the very first scene with the two women on a bench in the park (in hindsight) is telling. I really had my doubts about everything: the acting, the actions taken by the characters, the total mood and feel of the film. Once it goes into the 2nd act, the movie becomes more and more (non intentional) laughable and silly.\n\nAfter seeing this I read that Shyamalan intended this to be an expensive B-movie, in the tradition of Romero etc. If that&apos;s the case, then my original rating of 5 (outta 10) should be a 3. Because nowhere in the movie does this become apparent. If you want a good homage, take a look at Zach Snyder&apos;s Dawn of the Dead (although that&apos;s really a remake.) I don&apos;t like a these talented filmmakers who want to take $100 million budgets, to make movies who look like they&apos;ve been made for $10.000. But at least someone like Tarantino or Rodriquez adds originality and a real love for the genre. \n\nThe Happening is really bad as a serious film. As an homage it&apos;s boring and without heart. Take your pick. But you will be disappointed either way.",

   "reviewBody": "Miyazaki&apos;s My Neighbor Totoro is a film that should be able to put a smile on any viewers face, and without a doubt, it&apos;ll take you on one of the most whimsical and fantastic journey&apos;s ever.\n\nMy Neighbor Totoro is a story that definitely something children can relate with, as i watched this with someone, they immediately paused the film and asked if this reminded me of being 4 years old again. This film really connects with people. But it&apos;s far from a quality nostalgia piece, it&apos;s well animated, beautiful, avoids clich\u00e9 stereotypes (from both typical of the Anime genre and Children&apos;s Fantasy films), and is beautifully filmed (see scenes such as the girls waiting for the bus with Totoro and the scene where the magic nuts and seeds grow with the help of Totoro).\n\nEven the English dub done by Fox isn&apos;t as bad everyone states. I&apos;ve seen the Japanese version, and i&apos;d have to say it&apos;s a mixed-bag between having Mei&apos;s voice sounds a bit too bratty for the English version, or having the Father&apos;s voice sound a bit awkward and perhaps not as caring in the Japanese version. Disney is said to be releasing a re-dub in mid-to-late 2005, so perhaps that will even out the controversy.\n\nThis film may not reach the heights of other Anime classics (mainly it&apos;s double bill with Grave of the Fireflies, or Miyazaki&apos;s other masterpieces Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away), however this will definitely be high on any film lovers list, and is definitely a high water mark of it&apos;s genre.\n\nA solid 9/10, This film is next to impossible to watch without it pushing a smile out of your face.",

Same goes to Alfred Molina and it&apos;s always nice to see Monica Bellucci.\n\nBUT, there is one BIG problem and that is Jay Baruchel. Why, o why, they had to put him into this movie? He ruined it completely with his annoying appearance, voice and, above all, irritating not-at-all-talented acting. They should have find different actor for this role. I don&apos;t have someone in mind but this one is very wrong. Without him it would be a much better movie.\n\nBut, it&apos;s still entertaining, in spite of occasional not funny jokes which are forced into scenario. The story is bearable and neat effects pulls it out of average, slightly.",

The taste of each episode remained in my palate. Death, Love & Robots show the end point of the animation. Cyberpunk, love, death, technology, apocalyptic, a variety of topics such as space is told. So each viewer can find something in the series. There were criticisms of sexism and violence, but I didn&apos;t encounter such a problem. Episode lengths range from six to seventeen minutes. Although it is a little short, you can understand the quality when you watch. 9/10",

I don&apos;t even remember the day I started watching it and since then I waited the next year to come for the new season. I can&apos;t say anything more.

But I was proved wrong.\n\nSherlock Holmes seems to be like the new James Bond: gritty, hardcore, and always ready for a good fight. He is not only intellectually sophisticated but also quite a brawler. Watson his side kick who is his loyal friend is always there to save his dear partner from harm&apos;s way. Irene plays the notorious thief and lover of Mr. Holmes. She is a wily character who keeps the reader guessing her motives.\n\nThe cinematography of the movie was special because it showed parts of the film as Holmes&apos; future logical deductions. The movie also used the tradition method of explaining the Sherlock Holmes deductions after given the facts and clues.\n\nSherlock Holmes&apos; evil nemesis play his part well. There were many humorous antics and displays of ingenious traps. The other minor characters also added to the crude humor and laughter.\n\nOverall, this movie deserves to be watched. It comes with sparkles of spontaneity and fun. And it may even leave you wanting a sequel! Give it a try!",

   "reviewBody": "I really enjoyed this movie and I maybe one of the few that was not annoyed by Tom Cruise. Well as I&apos;m sure most people know this movie is about the failed assassination attempt of Adolf Hitler.\n\nThe acting was very good throughout. I actually enjoyed Tom Cruise&apos;s performance but he did not take the lead as strongly as he should have. He did what had to be done but he could have elevated this movie like he has done to others in the past. His role needed that maverick type attitude like he provided in Born On the Fourth of July. His non-German accent was not an issue it was the strength that he displayed in his performance that was disappointing to many. This movie was certainly a chance for him to build his career back up to a more serious level but he clearly did not impress too many people with his role as Stauffenburg to do that. Still, he was enjoyable to watch for me.\n\nThe supporting cast though was great. Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson were all pivotal in the success of this movie and they certainly filled in perfectly. All around they were great performances but who I especially liked was Christian Berkel who I haven&apos;t heard of before as well as Jamie Parker.\n\nThe directing of Bryan Singer was superb. He provided an amazing amount of suspense to a movie that everyone knew the ending to. For a good half hour I was totally frozen watching as the plot unfold. I also thought the movie was paced very well and he brought the best out of the supporting cast. Of course it was shot very well with a great production throughout. The movie was written very nicely but as many people have said, it would have been great if there was more emotional depth added to the characters to make the audience feel more attached them.\n\nThis movie certainly had a lot of potential but it stayed within the realm of mostly a suspense action movie. Valkryie reminded me of a WW2 movie from the 50s and 60s with its style and pacing. It&apos;s very interesting to think about what ifs&apos; and its kind of funny to think they almost pulled off the impossible without killing Hitler. Valkryie perfectly illustrates how the smallest of things can have the biggest impact.",

Though I only personally know Pappy out of these characters, it&apos;s obvious they are working as hard as they can (within Hollywood&apos;s tradition) to portray it as it happened. I hope they continue this series at least until the end of the invasion.

   "reviewBody": "There is absolutely no way I can view this film in even a remotely objective manner, so I won&apos;t even try. Like eveything I&apos;ve seen by Tim Burton, this film is at one and the same time, warm and frightening, tender and heart-wrenchingly evil, uplifting and dark. The good and bad in humanity are shown in stark relief quite clearly for everyone to see. But in the final analysis, the most important message the film has to offer is this: Love truly does make the world go &apos;round and redemption and just living to see another day is a kind of victory. There will always be bullies, just as there will always be kind souls who actively try to make things better (and who sometimes make things worse through their efforts). The most important thing is to be true to yourself, treat others as you wish to be treated and that if the bad guys win, we all lose-including the bad guys. Excellent cast, fine script and just overall a worthy effort not to be missed. One of Vincent Price&apos;s last performances, if not the last. I love this film! Most highly recommended.",
